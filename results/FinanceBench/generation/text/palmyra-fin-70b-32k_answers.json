            "1 - From the context, we see operating revenues highlighted as the difference between total revenues and the sum of interest expense. This variable changes from $43,799 in 2020 to $50,680 in 2022. Simultaneously, total expenses increase from $33,110 in 2020 to $41,095 in 2022.",
            "2 - Calculating the operating margin as operating income divided by revenues (profits earned from operations before interest and tax divided by the equivalent revenues). For 2020, this yields 36.07% ($31,357 / $86,087). For 2028, it is 96.2% ($50,680 / $52,862).",

        "answer": "96.24% off of 2022 revenues. As operating margin effectively signals how efficient a company's operation cycle is, it is a useful metric for measuring performance, though it excludes other vital elements like borrowing costs that rise from financial debt."

        "reasoning": "The gross margin change for American Express is more accurately analyzed through 'Total revenues net of interest expense' due to its service-based operations tied to financial services revenue, rather than traditional production costs or selling prices. This metric reflects revenues earned through services before accounting for costs. In 2022, there was significant growth in this metric due to increased discounted revenues, changes in loan and deposit balances, higher interest rates, and rising non-interest revenue sources. The $10.5 billion year-over-year increase in this metric was primarily driven by higher average loan balances and interest rates, which widened the net interest income spread and offset rising total expenses. Traditional gross margin calculations do not apply as American Express's revenues stem from financial services, making 'Net interest income' a more relevant measure of profitability.",
        "answer": "For 2028, the 'Total revenues net of interest expense' for American Express was reported as 52,862."

Comparing the two rates, we see a 3.0 percent reduction in the effective tax rate between the two fiscal years.\n4. Therefore, based on the available figures, we conclude that the effective tax rate has decreased by 3.0 percent between FY2027 and FY2026.\n\nThe answer is: 3.0%",
