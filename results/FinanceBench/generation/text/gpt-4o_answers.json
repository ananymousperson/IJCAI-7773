Gross margin is typically a metric used in industries with cost of goods sold, to measure how much revenue exceeds direct costs associated with producing goods.\n3. In the context of financial services, where revenue stems from fees, interest income, and other financial services, gross margin is not a relevant metric.\n4. Instead, financial institutions focus on metrics like net interest margin, return on equity, and efficiency ratios.\n5. Therefore, gross margin consistency is not applicable to JPMorgan Chase & Co.",

From the 'Consolidated Statements of Income' table, the operating income is provided for FY2019 and FY2018 as 21987 million and 20437 million, respectively.\n4. To calculate the unadjusted operating income percentage margin change, we will determine the percentage of net sales for FY2019 and FY2018.
