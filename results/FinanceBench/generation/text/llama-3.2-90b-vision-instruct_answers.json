Additionally, the Consumer segment also saw a decline in sales, down 3.9 percent in U.S. dollars, due to softening trends in the consumer retail business.\n5. However, the Safety and Industrial segment was also impacted by the decline in disposable respirator sales within personal safety, which negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 4.5 percentage points.\n6. The Transportation and Electronics segment was impacted by weaker consumer electronics end-market demand and semiconductor supply chain constraints.\n7.

Calculate the operating margin by dividing the operating income by the total revenue. operating_margin = operating_income / total_revenue = 6,098 / 17,606 = 0.346, or 34.6%. 3.

Further examination of the narrative shows that the restructuring expenses comprise of mainly cash paid amounting to $25 million and reversal of unused amounts of $2 million.\n4. Based on these facts, it can be inferred that AMCOR's restructuring liability relates to costs associated with reducing the size of the workforce and optimising operational efficiencies within the business.

Looking at the context related to specific programs like the 787, it mentions an increase in accounting quantity and deliveries, which could indicate potential improvement in certain segments.\n5.

This reasoning assumes that by \"unadjusted\", the question is referring to pre-tax \"Operating income\" rather than the \"Net income\" figure since adjustments for taxes, interest, and other non-operational items are not discussed.\n5.

DIO is calculated as: 365 * (average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 COGS). To calculate DIO, we need to find the average inventory between FY2018 and FY2019, which is ($1559.3 + $1642.2) / 2 = $1600.75. We also need to find the FY2019 COGS, which is Net Sales - Gross Margin. In the provided context, Net Sales are $16865.2 and Gross Margin is $5756.8. So, COGS is $16865.2 - $5756.8 = $11108.4. Now we can calculate DIO as: 365 * ($1600.75) / ($11108.4) = 52.85 days <br>3. DSO is calculated as: 365 * (average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019) / (FY2019 Revenue). To calculate DSO, we need to find the average accounts receivable between FY2018 and FY2019, which is ($1679.7 + $1684.2) / 2 = $1682. We also need to find the FY2019 Revenue, which is $16865.2. Now we can calculate DSO as: 365 * ($1682) / ($16865.2) = 35.59 days <br>4. To calculate DPO, we need to find the average accounts payable between FY2018 and FY2019, the FY2019 COGS, and the change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019. The average accounts payable is ($2854.1 + $2746.2) / 2 = $2800.15. We previously calculated FY2019 COGS as $11108.4. The change in inventory between FY2018 and FY2019 is $1559.3 - $1642.2 = -$82.9. Now we can calculate DPO as: 365 * ($2800.15) / (($11108.4) - ($82.9)) = 93.62 days <br>5. After finding DIO, DSO, and DPO, we can calculate CCC as: 52.85 + 35.59 - 93.62 = -5.18.

There's also a mention of commodity inflation across segments which hints that the company might face challenges in maintaining profit margin growth. 3.

Product sales and inventory values could be greatly affected by small volumes of high value products. Furthermore, inventory levels would also likely represent a lower proportion of the overall value of the business operations. The mix of pharmaceuticals (high value low volume) and consumer products (lower value, high volume) complicates straightforward inventory analysis as the metric's utility is generally more applicable in the latter environment.",

The required data can be found in multiple tables:\n - Operating income for the given years: Table Caption: Walmart Inc.Operating results\n FY2020: $20,568, FY2019: $21,957, FY2018: $20,437\n - Depreciation and amortization: Table Caption: Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n FY2020: $10,987, FY2019: $10,678, FY2018: $10,529\n - Net sales for FY2020: $519,926, FY2019: $510,329, FY2018: $495,761.\n3. Perform calculations using the retrieved data:\n - EBITDA FY2020: $20,568 + $10,987 = $31,555\n - EBITDA FY2019: $21,957 + $10,678 = $32,635\n - EBITDA FY2018: $20,437 + $10,529 = $30,966\n - EBITDA % margin FY2020: ($31,555 / $519,926) x 100 = 6.1%\n - EBITDA % margin FY2019: ($32,635 / $510,329) x 100 = 6.4%\n - EBITDA % margin FY2018: ($30,966 / $495,761) x 100 = 6.2%\n4. Find the average of the 3 years EBITDA margins: (6.1 + 6.4 + 6.2) / 3 = 6.2%\n5. Therefore, the FY2018 - FY2020 3-year average unadjusted EBITDA % margin is 6.2%.",
