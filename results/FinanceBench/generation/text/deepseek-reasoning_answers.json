        "reasoning": "To calculate the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for PepsiCo, we need to determine the unadjusted EBITDA and then divide it by the net revenue.\n\n1. **Unadjusted Operating Income**: From the P&L statement, the operating profit for 2022 is $11,512 million.\n\n2. **Depreciation and Amortization (D&A)**: The context does not provide the D&A directly from the cash flow statement. However, we can infer that the D&A is typically included in the operating profit calculation. Since the operating profit is already provided, we can assume that the D&A is part of the operating profit.\n\n3. **Unadjusted EBITDA**: Since the operating profit is already provided and includes D&A, we can consider the operating profit as the unadjusted EBITDA. Therefore, unadjusted EBITDA = $11,512 million.\n\n4. **Net Revenue**: From the P&L statement, the net revenue for 2022 is $86,392 million.\n\n5. **EBITDA % Margin**: The EBITDA % margin is calculated as (Unadjusted EBITDA / Net Revenue) * 100. Therefore, ($11,512 / $86,392) * 100 = 13.32%.\n\nThus, the FY2022 unadjusted EBITDA % margin for PepsiCo is 13.32%.",
