Analyzed the factors affecting gross margin:\n   - Negative currency impacts of $78 million\n   - Negative impact from disposed operations of $73 million\n   - Favorable operating cost performance of $56 million\n   - Pass-through of higher raw material costs significantly impacted the calculation\n\n3.
