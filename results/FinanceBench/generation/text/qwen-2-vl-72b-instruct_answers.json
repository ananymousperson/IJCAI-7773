We then sum up the capex for those years and divide it by the total revenue for those years. This gives us the capex as a % of revenue for the 3 years. Finally, we take the average of this value over the 3 years.\n1. From the cash flow statement, we find the capex for 2017, 2018, and 2019 are $155 million, $131 million, and $116 million respectively.\n2. From the statement of income, we calculate the total revenue for 2017, 2018, and 2019 as the sum of product sales, subscription, licensing, and other revenues. This gives us a total revenue of $7.017 billion, $7.500 billion, and $6.489 billion respectively.\n3. Summing up the capex and total revenue for the 3 years: Capex = $155 million + $131 million + $116 million = $402 million.\n Total revenue = $7.017 billion + $7.500 billion + $6.489 billion = $21.006 billion.\n4. Calculating the capex as a % of revenue: Capex % of revenue = ($402 million / $21.006 billion) * 100 = 1.9%.\n5.
