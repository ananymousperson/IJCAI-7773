        "reasoning": "The reduction in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (likely referenced as FY2023 in the question due to a typo) was primarily driven by leverage of marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales. This was partially offset by deleverage in store payroll/benefits (from wage investments) and corporate overhead (from strategic investments).",

        "reasoning": "The context states that the increase in merchandise inventories at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 (which aligns with FY2023 based on the January 28, 2023 reference) was primarily due to three factors: opening 47 new stores since January 29, 2022, inventory to support new brand launches/expansions, and inventory cost increases. These are explicitly listed as the drivers in the provided text.",

However, the provided context only includes data for fiscal 2022 (ended January 28, 2023). In fiscal 2022, Q4 repurchases were $328.1 million, and the total fiscal 2022 repurchases were $900.0 million. Since no FY 2023 repurchase data is available in the context, the calculation cannot be performed. The answer assumes a possible typo in the question (intending FY 2022).",

Foreign Exchange Forwards had a notional amount of $932 million in 2021. Other derivatives mentioned (e.g., swaptions, treasury rate locks) either lack explicit notional values for 2021 or have lower amounts. Thus, Cross Currency Swaps had the highest notional value.",

The first table lists 2024 payments as $1,998 million, and the second table lists 2024 payments as $10,014 million. Since the question asks for the total amount Verizon expected to pay for retirees in 2024, and the context implies these are separate benefit categories (pension and postretirement), the values are summed.",

For FY 2022, Verizon's cash and cash equivalents are $2,605 million, accounts receivable (net) are $24,506 million, and total current liabilities are $50,171 million. The quick ratio is ($2,605 + $24,506) / $50,171 = 0.54. A ratio below 1 suggests limited liquidity coverage. However, the context states Verizon relies on operational cash flow and external financing to meet obligations, indicating liquidity management beyond the quick ratio.

Additionally, the context explicitly states that Verizon's strategy 'requires significant capital investments' and 2022 was a 'peak year of capital investment' for C-Band spectrum deployment.

From the financial statements: FY2018 AP = $46,092 million, FY2017 AP = $41,433 million (average = $43,762.5 million). FY2018 COGS = $373,396 million. FY2018 inventory = $43,783 million, FY2017 inventory = $43,046 million (change = +$737 million).
