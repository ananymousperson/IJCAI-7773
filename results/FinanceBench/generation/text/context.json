        "3M_2018_10K.pdf_page_6": "Raw Materials\n\nIn 2018, the Company experienced raw material price inflation across most material markets worldwide. In response, the Company continued to deploy productivity projects to minimize the impact of raw material inflation and market supply challenges, including input management, reformulations, and multi-sourcing activities. These succeeded in partially offsetting the overall raw material headwinds experienced throughout the year. To date, the Company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. It is difficult to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3M has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories, strategic relationships with key suppliers, and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3M manages spend category price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and commodity price swaps.\n\nEnvironmental Law Compliance\n\n3M\u2019s manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to \u201cEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\u201d in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).\n\nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company\u2019s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n\nIn 2018, 3M expended approximately $27 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. This amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. Capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices \u2014 such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers \u2014 at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business. Consistent with the Company\u2019s emphasis on environmental responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be approximately $75 million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWhile the Company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance, the Company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.",

Management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. This includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. These estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. For instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group.\n\nOf the $2.7 billion in net identifiable intangible assets, $0.6 billion relates to indefinite-lived tradenames, primarily Capital Safety, whose tradenames ($520 million at acquisition date) have been in existence for over 55 years (refer to Note 4 for more detail). The primary valuation technique used in estimating the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets (tradenames) is a discounted cash flow approach. Specifically, a relief of royalty rate is applied to estimated sales, with the resulting amounts then discounted using an appropriate market/technology discount rate. The relief of royalty rate is the estimated royalty rate a market participant would pay to acquire the right to market/produce the product. If the resulting discounted cash flows are less than the book value of the indefinite lived intangible asset, impairment exists, and the asset value must be written down. Based on impairment testing in the third quarter 2018, no impairment was indicated. The discounted cash flows related to the Capital Safety tradenames exceeded its book value by more than 20 percent in aggregate.",

The Company places consistent emphasis on environmental responsibility. 3M has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 3M is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to \u201cEnvironmental Matters and Litigation\u201d in Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies).\n\nEnvironmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. Reserves for liabilities anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies, the Company\u2019s commitment to a plan of action, or approval by regulatory agencies. Environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.\n\nIn 2022, 3M expended approximately $317 million on capital projects for environmental purposes as defined below. Capital projects for environmental purposes include waste reduction and pollution control programs such as, water usage reduction and water quality improvement equipment, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers. Capital expenditures for similar projects are presently expected to approach approximately $646 million for 2023 and 2024 in aggregate.\n\nAlthough an estimate of certain nearer-term capital expenditures is provided above, 3M cannot predict with certainty whether future costs of compliance with government regulations (including environmental regulations) will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.",

The Company expects 2023 capital spending to be approximately $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion as 3M continues to invest in growth, productivity and sustainability.\n\n3M records capital-related government grants earned as reductions to the cost of property, plant and equipment; and associated unpaid liabilities and grant proceeds receivable are considered non-cash changes in such balances for purposes of preparation of statement of cash flows.\n\n39\n\nTable of Contents\n\n3M invests in renewal and maintenance programs, which pertain to cost reduction, cycle time, maintaining and renewing current capacity, eliminating pollution, and compliance. Costs related to maintenance, ordinary repairs, and certain other items are expensed. 3M also invests in growth, which adds to capacity, driven by new products, both through expansion of current facilities and new facilities. Finally, 3M also invests in other initiatives, such as information technology (IT), laboratory facilities, and a continued focus on investments in sustainability.\n\nRefer to Note 3 for information on acquisitions and divestitures (including the cash payment from the Food Safety business split-off). The Company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses.\n\nPurchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from maturities and sale of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to certificates of deposit/time deposits, commercial paper, and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. Refer to Note 11 for more details about 3M\u2019s diversified marketable securities portfolio.

Investing in 3M\u2019s business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The Company\u2019s primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M\u2019s commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance.

Additionally, the Company\u2019s debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. As of June 2023, 3M has a credit rating of A2, negative outlook from Moody's Investors Service, and a credit rating of A-, CreditWatch negative from S&P Global Ratings.\n\nThe Company\u2019s total debt at June 30, 2023 was consistent when compared to December 31, 2022 as maturities of $1.8 billion of fixed-rate notes were offset by issuances of commercial paper of $1.8 billion. For discussion of repayments of and proceeds from debt refer to the following Cash Flows from Financing Activities section.\n\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority announced that it would no longer require banks to submit rates for the London InterBank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) after 2021. In November 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), LIBOR\u2019s administrator, proposed extending the publication of USD LIBOR through June 2023. Subsequently, in March of 2021, IBA ceased publication of certain LIBOR rates after December 31, 2021. USD LIBOR rates that did not cease on December 31, 2021 will continue to be published through June 30, 2023, and certain USD LIBOR rates subject to a synthetic methodology will continue to be published until September 2024. The Company anticipates its debt securities, bank facilities, and derivative instruments that previously utilized LIBOR as the reference rate will transition to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, as a reference rate as necessary.\n\nEffective February 8, 2023, the Company updated its \u201cwell-known seasoned issuer\u201d (WKSI) shelf registration statement, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future issuance and sale. This replaced 3M\u2019s previous shelf registration dated February 10, 2020. In May 2016, 3M entered into an amended and restated distribution agreement relating to the future issuance and sale (from time to time) of the Company\u2019s medium-term notes program (Series F), up to the aggregate principal amount of $18 billion, which was an increase from the previous aggregate principal amount up to $9 billion of the same Series. As of June 30, 2023, the total amount of debt issued as part of the medium-term notes program (Series F), inclusive of debt issued in February 2019 and prior years is approximately $17.6 billion (utilizing the foreign exchange rates applicable at the time of issuance for the euro denominated debt). Information with respect to long-term debt issuances and maturities for the periods presented is included in Note 10 of this Form 10-Q and Note 12 in 3M's 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nIn May 2023, 3M entered into a $4.25 billion five-year revolving credit facility expiring in 2028; the facility was amended in July 2023. The revolving credit agreement includes a provision under which 3M may request an increase of up to $1.0 billion (at lender\u2019s discretion), bringing the total facility up to $5.25 billion. The agreement replaced the amended and restated $3.0 billion, five-year revolving credit agreement and the $1.25 billion 364-day credit facility that would have expired in November 2024 and November 2023, respectively. The credit facility was undrawn at June 30, 2023. Under the $4.25 billion credit facility, the Company is required to maintain its EBITDA to Interest Ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. This is calculated (based on amounts defined in the amended agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total EBITDA for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period.

We exited fiscal 2015 with 6.167 million paid Creative Cloud subscriptions, up 78% from 3.458 million at the end of fiscal 2014.\n\nOur Digital Media segment also includes our Document Cloud products and solutions, including our newly released Acrobat DC product which helped grow Document Cloud ARR to $397 million exiting fiscal 2015, up from $265 million at the end of fiscal 2014.\n\nTotal Digital Media ARR grew to approximately $3.00 billion at the end of fiscal 2015, up from $1.88 billion at the end of fiscal 2014, demonstrating the progress we have made with the transformation of our business to a more recurring, ratable and predictable revenue model. Our reported ARR results in fiscal 2015 are based on currency rates set at the start of fiscal 2015 and held constant throughout the year. Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2015 using currency rates at the beginning of fiscal 2016, our Digital Media ARR at the end of fiscal 2015 would be $2.88 billion or approximately $114 million lower than the ARR reported above.\n\nWe are a market leader in the fast-growing category addressed by our Digital Marketing segment. Our Adobe Marketing Cloud now includes eight solutions which address the expanding needs of marketers. In fiscal 2015, we achieved record Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.36 billion, which represents 16% year-over-year revenue growth. In addition, we drove strong demand and bookings growth for our Marketing Cloud solutions, which we expect will positively benefit revenue growth in future quarters.\n\nFinancial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2015\n\n+ During fiscal 2015, our subscription revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to 67% from 50% compared with fiscal 2014, as we transitioned more of our business to a subscription-based model.\n\n* Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $3.00 billion as of November 27, 2015 increased by $1.12 billion, or 60%, from $1.88 billion as of November 28, 2014. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to increases in the number of paid Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions and continued adoption of our ETLAs, and to a lesser extent, the adoption of our Document Cloud offering through our ETLAs and increases in Document Cloud subscriptions.\n\n+ Adobe Marketing Cloud revenue of $1.36 billion increased by $188.5 million, or 16%, during fiscal 2015, from $1.17 billion in fiscal 2014. The increases were primarily due to continued adoption of our Adobe Experience Manager (\u201cAEM\u201d) offering and increases in Adobe Campaign and Adobe Analytics revenue.\n\nOur total deferred revenue of $1.49 billion as of November 27, 2015 increased by $330.0 million, or 29%, from $1.16 billion as of November 28, 2014, primarily due to increases in Creative Cloud individual and team subscriptions, ETLAs and new contracts and existing renewals for our Adobe Marketing Cloud services. Also contributing to the increase in deferred revenue were the increases associated with our stock photography offering from the acquisition of Fotolia in fiscal 2015.\n\n* Cost of revenue of $744.3 million increased by $122.2 million, or 20%, during fiscal 2015, from $622.1 million in fiscal 2014. The increases were primarily due to increases in costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and costs of professional services driven by the increase in our professional services business.\n\nOperating expenses of $3.15 billion increased by $35.8 million during fiscal 2015, from $3.11 billion in fiscal 2014. The increase is due to higher costs associated with compensation and related benefits driven by additional headcount and amortization of intangibles from the Fotolia acquisition in fiscal 2015.\n\nNet income of $629.6 million increased by $361.2 million, or 135%, during fiscal 2015 from $268.4 million in fiscal 2014 primarily due to revenue growth.\n\n+\n\nNet cash flow from operations of $1.47 billion during fiscal 2015 increased by $182.0 million, or 14%, from $1.29 billion during fiscal 2014 primarily due to higher net income.\n\n40",

While we continued to provide Digital Media services in Ukraine, we also reduced our Digital Media ARR balance by an additional $12 million, which represented our Digital Media business in Ukraine.

On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.\n\nWe expect spending in technology and content will increase over time as we add computer scientists, designers, software and hardware engineers, and merchandising employees. Our technology and content investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We seek to invest efficiently in several areas of technology and content, including AWS, and expansion of new and existing product categories and service offerings, as well as in technology infrastructure to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiencies. We believe that advances in technology, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people\u2019s lives. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all sizes.\n\nWe seek to efficiently manage shareholder dilution while maintaining the flexibility to issue shares for strategic purposes, such as financings, acquisitions, and aligning employee compensation with shareholders\u2019 interests. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 497 million and 504 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2017.\n\nOur financial reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar and changes in foreign exchange rates significantly affect our reported results and consolidated trends . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency changes.\n\nIn addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated trends and comparisons.\n\nFor additional information about each line item summarized above, refer to Item 8 of Part II, \u201cFinancial Statements and Supplementary Data\u2014Note 1\u2014 Description of Business and Accounting Policies.\u201d\n\n(3)\n\nThe operating cycle is the number of days of sales in inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days.\n\n20\n\nTable of Contents",

The Company's history dates back more than 150 years, with origins in both Australia and the United States of America. Today, Amcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal-care, and other consumer goods end markets. The Company's innovation excellence and global packaging expertise enables the Company to solve packaging challenges around the world every day, producing packaging that is more functional, appealing, and cost effective for its customers and their consumers and importantly, more sustainable for the environment.\n\nThe Company's business activities are organized around two reportable segments, Flexibles and Rigid Packaging. The Company has a globally diverse operating footprint, selling to customers in Europe, North America, Latin America, and the Asia Pacific regions. The Company develops and produces a broad range of packaging products including flexible packaging, rigid packaging containers, specialty cartons, and closures. The Company's sales are widely diversified, with the majority of sales made to the food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical device, home and personal care, and other consumer goods end markets. All markets are considered to be highly competitive as to price, innovation, quality, and service.\n\n55",
        "AMCOR_2023_10K.pdf_page_28": "29\n\nOverview\n\nAmcor is a global leader in developing and producing responsible packaging for food, beverage, pharmaceutical, medical, home and personal- care, and other products. We work with leading companies around the world to protect their products and the people who rely on them, differentiate brands, and improve supply chains through a range of flexible and rigid packaging, specialty cartons, closures, and services. We are focused on making packaging that is increasingly light-weighted, recyclable and reusable, and made using an increasing amount of recycled content. During fiscal year 2023, Amcor generated $14.7 billion in sales from operations that spanned 218 locations in over 40 countries.\n\nSignificant Developments Affecting the Periods Presented\n\nEconomic and Market Conditions\n\nDuring fiscal year 2023, we have continued to experience intermittent supply shortages and price volatility of certain resins and raw materials as a result of market dynamics, especially in the first half of fiscal year 2023, and higher rates of inflation impacting energy, fuel, and labor costs. In addition, higher inflation, especially in Europe and the United States, has led central banks to rapidly raise interest rates to dampen inflation which results in higher interest expense on our variable rate debt particularly U.S. dollar and Euro denominated debt. The underlying causes for the continued volatility can be attributed to a variety of factors, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and higher inflation in many economies, which has resulted in increased volatility in energy and food markets and impacted global economies. This has led to reduced consumer demand for certain of our products and customer destocking in fiscal year 2023.\n\nWe will continue to work closely with our suppliers and customers, leveraging our global capabilities and expertise to work through supply chain disruptions and other resulting issues. In addition, we are focused on driving costs out of our business in this challenging environment and recovering higher raw material costs to help mitigate inflation. However, there could be a time lag between recognizing the benefit of our mitigating actions and when the inflation occurs, and there is no assurance that measures taken will be able to fully mitigate the impact of ongoing inflation. While we expect customer destocking to abate in the short-term and consumer demand to improve incrementally throughout fiscal year 2024, there is no assurance that demand will rebound.",

Our values of Safety, Integrity, Collaboration, Accountability, and Results and Outperformance guide our behavior, driving our winning aspiration to be THE leading global packaging company.\n\nShareholder value creation\n\nThrough our portfolio of focused businesses and differentiated capabilities, we generate strong cash flow and redeploy cash to consistently create superior value for shareholders. The nature of our consumer and healthcare end markets means that year-to-year volatility should be relatively low, measured on a constant currency basis. Over time, value creation has been strong and consistent and has reflected a combination of dividends, organic growth in the base business, and using free cash flow to pursue targeted acquisitions and/or returning cash to shareholders via share buybacks.",
        "AMCOR_2023_10K.pdf_page_22": "Environmental, Health, and Safety regulations \u2014 Changing government regulations in environmental, health, and safety matters, including climate change, may adversely affect our company.\n\nNumerous legislative and regulatory initiatives have been passed and anticipated in response to concerns about greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. We are a manufacturing entity that utilizes petrochemical-based raw materials to produce many of our products. Increased environmental legislation or regulation, including regulations related to extended producer responsibility (\"EPR\"), could result in higher costs for us in the form of higher raw material cost, increased energy and freight costs, and new taxes on packaging products or result in reduced demand. It is possible that certain materials might cease to be permitted to be used in our processes. Government bans of, or restrictions on, certain materials or packaging formats may close off markets to Amcor's business.\n\nIn addition, changes to environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and standards are made or proposed regularly, and some of the proposals, if adopted, might, directly or indirectly, result in a material reduction in the operating results of one or more of our operating units. For instance, an increase in legislation with respect to litter related to plastic packaging or related recycling programs may cause legislators in some countries and regions in which our products are sold to consider banning or limiting certain packaging formats or materials, or applying taxes or fees on some types of our products.\n\n23\n\nAdditionally, increased regulation of emissions linked to climate change, including greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-related regulations, could potentially increase the cost of our operations due to increased costs of compliance (which may not be recoverable through adjustment of prices), increased cost of fossil fuel-based inputs and increased cost of energy intensive raw material inputs. However, any such changes are uncertain, and we cannot predict the amount of additional capital expenses or operating expenses that would be necessary for compliance.\n\nMandates to use certain types of materials, such as post-consumer recycled (\"PCR\") content, may lead to supply shortages and higher prices for those materials as current recycling rates may be insufficient to meet increased demand for PCR within and beyond the packaging industry. We could also incur additional compliance costs for monitoring and reporting emissions and for maintaining permits. Additionally, a sizable portion of our business comes from healthcare packaging and food and beverage packaging, both highly regulated markets. If we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements, our results of operations could be adversely impacted."

Adjusted EBIT of $1,608 million;\n\nStrong total cash returns to shareholders of $1.2 billion: annual dividend increased to 49.0 cents per share; $431 million of shares repurchased (approximately 3% of outstanding shares); and\n\n* Fiscal 2024 outlook: Adjusted EPS of 67-71 cents per share. Adjusted Free Cash Flow of $850-950 million.\n\nAmcor CEO Ron Delia said: \u201cThroughout fiscal 2023, our teams did an excellent job proactively recovering inflation and reducing costs in a highly challenging environment. Adjusted EBIT grew modestly in comparable constant currency terms and we returned $1.2 billion of cash to shareholders. After delivering earnings growth of 8% in the first half, demand softened considerably and customer destocking persisted through the last two quarters of the year.\n\nWhile we expect current market conditions to continue in the near-term, we have visibility to a number of controllable factors we believe will support a return to solid earnings growth in the second half of fiscal 2024 and leave us well placed to grow at our long term trend of high-single digit rates thereafter. We are pricing to compensate for inflation and we expect benefits from our cost reduction and productivity initiatives will have a favorable and sustainable impact on operating leverage. In addition, we expect the headwinds from the sale of our Russian plants and higher interest expense will be largely limited to the first half.\n\nWe remain focused on our long-term growth strategy and will continue to pursue opportunities to invest in the business, particularly through innovation and sustainability initiatives in faster growing, higher value markets. We will also continue pursuing value-creating M&A and returning cash to shareholders through share repurchases and a compelling and growing dividend.\u201d",

On a comparable constant currency basis, net sales were approximately 3% lower than last year, reflecting price/mix benefits of approximately 1% offset by approximately 4% lower volumes.\n\nIn North America, overall beverage volumes were 6% lower than last year. Hot fill beverage container volumes were in line with the prior year as new business wins in key categories offset unfavorable consumer demand and customer destocking. Combined preform and cold fill container volumes were lower than the prior year. Overall specialty container volumes were lower than the prior year with growth in the healthcare, dairy and nutrition categories offset by weaker volumes in the food and home and personal care categories.\n\nIn Latin America, volumes declined at low single digit rates which reflects challenging economic conditions across the region.\n\nAdjusted EBIT of $265 million was lower than the prior year on a comparable constant currency basis, reflecting lower volumes and unfavorable mix trends, partly offset by favorable operating cost performance.\n\nAdjusted EBIT margin of 7.5% includes an adverse impact of approximately 80 basis points related to the increased sales dollars associated with passing through higher raw material costs and general inflation."

From time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its intellectual property (IP) portfolio.\n\nOn February 14, 2022 (the Xilinx Acquisition Date), the Company completed the acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx). On May 26, 2022 (the Pensando Acquisition Date), the Company completed the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). See Note 5 - Business Combinations for additional information on these acquisitions.\n\nNOTE 2 - Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nFiscal Year. The Company uses a 52- or 53-week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. Fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 ended on December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. Fiscal 2022 consisted of 53 weeks, and fiscal 2021 and 2020 each consisted of 52 weeks.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation. The consolidated financial statements include the Company's accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. Upon consolidation, all inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nReclassification. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.\n\nUse of Estimates. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of commitments and contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results are likely to differ from those estimates, and such differences may be material to the financial statements. Areas where management uses subjective judgment include, but are not limited to, revenue allowances, inventory valuation, valuation of goodwill and long-lived and intangible assets, and income taxes.",

As of December 31, 2022, the aggregate transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations under contracts with an original expected duration of more than one year was $247 million, of which $213 million is expected to be recognized in the next 12 months. The revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations does not include amounts which have an original expected duration of one year or less.\n\nRevenue recognized over time associated with custom products and development services accounted for approximately 24%, 23% and 18% of the Company's revenue in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nNOTE 4 - Segment Reporting\n\nManagement, including the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, reviews and assesses operating performance using segment net revenue and operating income (loss). These performance measures include the allocation of expenses to the reportable segments based on management's judgment. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, the Company updated its segment reporting structure to align financial reporting with the manner in which the Company manages its business in strategic end markets. The Company's disclosed measure of segment operating results has been updated consistent with the revised manner in which the Company's CODM assesses the company\u2019s financial performance and allocates resources. All prior-period segment data have been retrospectively adjusted.\n\nThe Company's four reportable segments are:\n\n+ the Data Center segment, which primarily includes server CPUs and GPUs, DPUs, FPGAs and Adaptive SoC products for data centers;\n\n+ the Client segment, which primarily includes CPUs, accelerated processing units that integrate microprocessors and GPUs (APUs), and chipsets desktop and notebook personal computers;\n\n+\n\nthe Gaming segment, which primarily includes discrete GPUs, semi-custom SoC products and development services; and\n\n+ the Embedded segment, which primarily includes embedded CPUs and GPUs, FPGAs, and Adaptive SoC products.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company may also sell or license portions of its IP portfolio.\n\nIn addition to these reportable segments, the Company has an All Other category, which is not a reportable segment. This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and credits in evaluating the performance of the reportable segments. This category primarily includes amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation expense, acquisition-related costs and licensing gain.\n\n64",

Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\n\nOverview\n\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a significant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. With the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022, we expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data processing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to provide the industry's broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of ownership for leading-edge data centers.\n\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64% increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC\u2122 server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022, was 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Operating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\n\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the 4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured obligations.\n\n40\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe also entered into a revolving credit agreement in June 2022. The agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2022, we established a new commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\nWe continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering a number of new leadership products and technologies during 2022. For Data Center, we launched our 4th Gen AMD EPYC\u2122 processors with next-generation architecture, technology and features, and designed to deliver optimizations across market segments and applications, while helping businesses free data center resources to create additional workload processing and accelerate output. We also unveiled our 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors with AMD 3D V-Cache technology for leadership performance in technical computing workloads. We introduced the 7 nm Versal\u2122 ACAP VCK5000 development card designed to offer leadership Al inference performance. We announced the availability of the AMD Instinct\u2122 ecosystem, the new AMD Instinct MI210 accelerator and ROCm\u2122 5 software. Together the AMD Instinct and ROCm ecosystem offers exascale-class technology to a broad base of high performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (Al) customers, designed to address the demand for compute-accelerated data center workloads and reduce the time to insights and discoveries.\n\nIn the Embedded segment, we introduced the AMD Ryzen\u2122 Embedded R2000 Series, second-generation mid-range system-on-chip processors optimized for a wide range of industrial and robotics systems, machine vision, loT (Internet of Things) and thin-client equipment. We also introduced the Kria\u2122 KR260 Robotics Starter Kit, the latest addition to the Kria portfolio. The kit enables rapid development of hardware-accelerated applications for robotics, machine vision and industrial communication and control.\n\nFor the Client segment, we introduced the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors powered by the new \u201cZen 4\u201d architecture for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. Along with the introduction of the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors, we also unveiled the new Socket AM5 platform featuring four new chipsets. These new desktop processors are designed for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. We introduced AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile processors with up to 16 \u201cZen 4\u201d architecture cores. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen 6000 Series Mobile processors, built on \u201cZen 3+\u201d architecture and includes AMD RDNA\u2122 2 architecture based on integrated graphics. We launched the AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series processors bringing \u201cZen 3\u201d architecture to premium Chrome OS devices for work and collaboration. The processors offer up to eight high performance x86 cores. For workstations, we introduced the new AMD Ryzen Threadripper\u2122 PRO 5000 WX-Series workstation processors designed for professionals to run demanding workstation applications. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen PRO 7030 Series Mobile processors built on \u201cZen 3\u201d core architecture.\n\nIn the Gaming segment, we unveiled the AMD Radeon\u2122 RX 7900 XTX and the Radeon RX 7900 XT gaming graphics cards that are built on next-generation high performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNA\u2122 3 architecture. We announced new graphics cards to the AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series product line: the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT, the AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT and the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT. These new graphics cards are built on AMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture and GDDR6 memory at up to 18Gbps. We launched the new AMD Radeon PRO GPUs including the introduction of the AMD Radeon PRO W6400 graphics card built on AMD RDNA 2 architecture.\n\nAlthough the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions during 2022. We continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\n\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n\n41\n\nTable of Contents",

        "AMD_2022_10K.pdf_page_19": "The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries into which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\n\nIndustry-wide fluctuations in the computer marketplace have materially adversely affected us in the past and may materially adversely affect us in the future. Our Client segment revenue is focused on the consumer desktop and notebook PC segments, which in the second half of 2022 experienced a decline as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. In the past, revenues from the Client and Gaming segments have experienced a decline driven by, among other factors, the adoption of smaller and other form factors, increased competition and changes in replacement cycles. The success of our semi-custom SoC products is dependent on securing customers for our semi-custom design pipeline and consumer market conditions, including the success of the Sony PlayStation\u00ae 5, Microsoft\u00ae Xbox\u2122 Series S and Microsoft\u00ae Xbox\u2122 Series X game console systems and next generation consoles for Sony and Microsoft, worldwide. In addition, the GPU market has at times seen elevated demand due to the application of GPU products to cryptocurrency mining. For example, our GPU revenue has been affected in part by the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market. Demand for cryptocurrency has changed and is likely to continue to change quickly. For example, China has banned such activities, and corresponding interest in mining of such currencies are subject to significant fluctuations. Alternatively, countries have created and may continue to create their own cryptocurrencies or equivalents that could also impact interest in mining. If we are unable to manage the risks related to the volatility of the cryptocurrency mining market, our GPU business could be materially adversely affected.",

The adoption of a new ERP system is a major undertaking and poses several challenges, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Costs and risks inherent in the conversion to our upgraded and new system may include disruptions to business continuity, difficulty in maintaining effective internal controls, administrative and technical problems, interruptions or delays in sales processes, expenditure overruns, and data migration issues. If we do not properly address or mitigate these issues it could result in increased costs and the diversion of management's attention and resources, negatively impacting our operating results and ability to effectively manage our business. Moreover, once our ERP system is upgraded, it may not operate as we expect it to\n\n24\n\nus.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nand cause disruption to our operations. There are no assurances that our new ERP system will be successfully implemented and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n\nUncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe typically sell our products pursuant to individual purchase orders. We generally do not have long-term supply arrangements with our customers or minimum purchase requirements except that orders generally must be for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers\u2019 estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are sold indirectly through downstream channel distributors and customers, as our forecasts for demand are then based on estimates provided by multiple parties throughout the downstream channel. For instance, we have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for any reason. For example, in the second half of 2022, we experienced a decline in our Client segment revenue as a result of weak PC market macroeconomic conditions and inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. We may build inventories during periods of anticipated growth, and the cancellation or deferral of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nExcess or obsolete inventory have and may in the future result in write-downs of the value of our inventory. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, we recorded certain charges primarily for inventory, pricing and related reserves in the Gaming and Client segments. Other factors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory include, a reduction in the average selling price, or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions."

        "AMD_2022_10K.pdf_page_42": "Introduction\n\nIn this section, we will describe the general financial condition and the results of operations of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (collectively, \u201cus,\u201d \u201cour\u201d or \u201cAMD\u201d), including a discussion of our results of operations for 2022 compared to 2021, an analysis of changes in our financial condition and a discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements. Discussions of 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 25, 2021.\n\nOverview\n\n2022 was a transformative year for AMD as we took several major steps that scaled and reshaped our business. In February 2022, we completed our strategic acquisition of Xilinx, Inc. (Xilinx) which expanded our technology and product portfolio to include adaptable hardware platforms that enable hardware acceleration and rapid innovation across a variety of technologies and established AMD in multiple embedded markets where we have traditionally not had a significant presence. We now offer Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Adaptive SoCs, and Adaptive Compute Acceleration Platform (ACAP) products. With the acquisition of Xilinx, we have access to a new set of markets and customers, further strengthening and diversifying our business model. In May 2022, we expanded our data center solutions capabilities with the acquisition of Pensando Systems, Inc. (Pensando). We now offer high-performance data processing units (DPUs) and a software stack that complements our existing products. With the Xilinx and Pensando acquisitions, we are well positioned to provide the industry's broadest set of leadership compute engines and accelerators to help enable best performance, security, flexibility and total cost of ownership for leading-edge data centers.\n\nOur 2022 financial results reflect the strength of our diversified business model despite the challenging PC market conditions in the second half of 2022. Net revenue for 2022 was $23.6 billion, an increase of 44% compared to 2021 net revenue of $16.4 billion. The increase in net revenue was driven by a 64% increase in Data Center segment revenue primarily due to higher sales of our EPYC\u2122 server processors, a 21% increase in Gaming segment revenue primarily due to higher semi-custom product sales, and a significant increase in Embedded segment revenue from the prior year period driven by the inclusion of Xilinx embedded product sales. This growth was partially offset by a 10% decrease in Client segment revenue primarily due to lower processor shipments driven by a weak PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain. Gross margin, as a percentage of net revenue for 2022, was 45%, compared to 48% in 2021. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Operating income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to operating income of $3.6 billion for 2021. The decrease in operating income was primarily driven by amortization of intangible assets associated with the Xilinx acquisition. Net income for 2022 was $1.3 billion compared to $3.2 billion in the prior year. The decrease in net income was primarily driven by lower operating income.\n\nCash, cash equivalents and short-term investments as of December 31, 2022 were $5.9 billion, compared to $3.6 billion at the end of 2021. Our aggregate principal amount of total debt as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion, compared to $313 million as of December 25, 2021.\n\nWe took several actions in 2022 to strengthen our financial position. In June 2022, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.924% Senior Notes due 2032 (3.924% Notes) and $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.393% Senior Notes due 2052 (4.393% Notes). The 3.924% Notes will mature on June 1, 2032 and bear interest at a rate of 3.924% per annum, and the 4.393% Notes will mature on June 1, 2052 and bear interest at a rate of 4.393% per annum. The 3.924% Notes and the 4.393% Notes are senior unsecured obligations.\n\n40\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe also entered into a revolving credit agreement in June 2022. The agreement provides for a five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in the aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion. There were no funds drawn from this facility during the year ended December 31, 2022. In November 2022, we established a new commercial paper program, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum principal amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion with a maturity of up to 397 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper will be sold at a discount from par or, alternatively, will be sold at par and bear interest at rates that will vary based on market conditions at the time of issuance. As of December 31, 2022, we had no commercial paper outstanding.\n\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, we returned a total of $3.7 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 36.3 million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program. As of December 31, 2022, $6.5 billion remained available for future stock repurchases under this program. The repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any common stock, has no termination date and may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\nWe continued executing our product technology roadmap by delivering a number of new leadership products and technologies during 2022. For Data Center, we launched our 4th Gen AMD EPYC\u2122 processors with next-generation architecture, technology and features, and designed to deliver optimizations across market segments and applications, while helping businesses free data center resources to create additional workload processing and accelerate output. We also unveiled our 3rd Gen AMD EPYC processors with AMD 3D V-Cache technology for leadership performance in technical computing workloads. We introduced the 7 nm Versal\u2122 ACAP VCK5000 development card designed to offer leadership Al inference performance. We announced the availability of the AMD Instinct\u2122 ecosystem, the new AMD Instinct MI210 accelerator and ROCm\u2122 5 software. Together the AMD Instinct and ROCm ecosystem offers exascale-class technology to a broad base of high performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (Al) customers, designed to address the demand for compute-accelerated data center workloads and reduce the time to insights and discoveries.\n\nIn the Embedded segment, we introduced the AMD Ryzen\u2122 Embedded R2000 Series, second-generation mid-range system-on-chip processors optimized for a wide range of industrial and robotics systems, machine vision, loT (Internet of Things) and thin-client equipment. We also introduced the Kria\u2122 KR260 Robotics Starter Kit, the latest addition to the Kria portfolio. The kit enables rapid development of hardware-accelerated applications for robotics, machine vision and industrial communication and control.\n\nFor the Client segment, we introduced the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors powered by the new \u201cZen 4\u201d architecture for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. Along with the introduction of the Ryzen 7000 Series Desktop processors, we also unveiled the new Socket AM5 platform featuring four new chipsets. These new desktop processors are designed for gamers, enthusiasts, and content creators. We introduced AMD Ryzen 7000 Mobile processors with up to 16 \u201cZen 4\u201d architecture cores. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen 6000 Series Mobile processors, built on \u201cZen 3+\u201d architecture and includes AMD RDNA\u2122 2 architecture based on integrated graphics. We launched the AMD Ryzen 5000 C-Series processors bringing \u201cZen 3\u201d architecture to premium Chrome OS devices for work and collaboration. The processors offer up to eight high performance x86 cores. For workstations, we introduced the new AMD Ryzen Threadripper\u2122 PRO 5000 WX-Series workstation processors designed for professionals to run demanding workstation applications. We also introduced the AMD Ryzen PRO 7030 Series Mobile processors built on \u201cZen 3\u201d core architecture.\n\nIn the Gaming segment, we unveiled the AMD Radeon\u2122 RX 7900 XTX and the Radeon RX 7900 XT gaming graphics cards that are built on next-generation high performance, energy-efficient AMD RDNA\u2122 3 architecture. We announced new graphics cards to the AMD Radeon RX 6000 Series product line: the AMD Radeon RX 6950 XT, the AMD Radeon RX 6750 XT and the AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT. These new graphics cards are built on AMD RDNA 2 gaming architecture and GDDR6 memory at up to 18Gbps. We launched the new AMD Radeon PRO GPUs including the introduction of the AMD Radeon PRO W6400 graphics card built on AMD RDNA 2 architecture.\n\nAlthough the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our business operations and practices, we experienced limited disruptions during 2022. We continue to monitor our operations and public health measures implemented by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic.\n\nWe intend the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations that follows to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from period to period, the primary factors that resulted in those changes, and how certain accounting principles, policies and estimates affect our financial statements.\n\n41\n\nTable of Contents",

At the time an investment is made, investments in commercial paper of industrial firms and financial institutions are rated A1, P1, F1 or better. The Company invests in bonds that are rated A, A2 or better and repurchase agreements, each of which have securities of the type and quality listed above as collateral.\n\nThe Company believes that concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers make up the Company's customer base, thus diluting the trade credit risk. One customer accounted for approximately 18% of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2022. Two customers each accounted for approximately 20% and 15% of the total consolidated accounts receivable balance as of December 25, 2021. However, the Company does not believe the receivable balance from these customers represents a significant credit risk based on past collection experience and review of their current credit quality.\n\nThe Company is exposed to credit losses from nonperformance by counterparties on foreign currency hedge contracts. These counterparties are large global institutions, and to date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company.",

These network partners are licensed to issue local currency American Express-branded cards in their countries and/or serve as the merchant acquirer for local merchants on our network.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, worldwide network services processed volume (spending on American Express cards issued by third parties) was $214.5 billion and at December 31, 2022, we had 56.5 million cards-in-force issued by third parties worldwide.\n\nDiverse Customer Base and Global Footprint\n\nOur broad and diverse customer base spans consumers, small businesses, mid-sized companies and large corporations around the world.

We also have a significant ownership position in, and extensive commercial arrangements with, Global Business Travel Group, Inc. (GBTG), which provides business travel-related services.\n\nDelta is our largest strategic partner. Our relationships with, and revenues and expenses related to, Delta are significant and represent an important source of value for our Card Members. We issue cards under cobrand arrangements with Delta and the Delta cobrand portfolio represented approximately 10 percent of worldwide network volumes and approximately 21 percent of worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2022. The Delta cobrand portfolio generates fee revenue and interest income from Card Members and discount revenue from Delta and other merchants for spending on Delta cobrand cards. The current Delta cobrand agreement runs through the end of 2029 and we expect to continue to make significant investments in this partnership. Among other things, Delta is also a key participant in our Membership Rewards program, provides travel-related benefits and services, including airport lounge access for certain American Express Card Members, accepts American Express cards as a merchant and is a corporate payments customer.\n\nWorking with all of our partners, we seek to provide value, choice and unique experiences across our customer base.",

Regulation and other governmental actions relating to pricing or practices could affect all networks directly or indirectly, as well as adversely impact consumers and merchants. Among other things, regulation of bankcard fees has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the discount revenue we earn, including as a result of downward pressure on our merchant discount rates from decreases in competitor pricing in connection with caps on interchange fees. In some cases, regulations also extend to certain aspects of our business, such as network and cobrand arrangements or the terms of card acceptance for merchants, and we have exited our network businesses in the EU and Australia as a result of regulation in those jurisdictions, for example. There is uncertainty as to when or how interchange fee caps and other provisions of the EU payments legislation might apply when we work with cobrand partners and agents in the EU. Given differing interpretations by regulators and participants in cobrand arrangements, we are subject to regulatory action, penalties and the possibility we will not be able to maintain our existing cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. See \u201cOur business is subject to comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\u201d under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\n\n17\n\nTable of Contents\n\nIn various countries, such as certain Member States in the EU and Australia, merchants are permitted by law to surcharge card purchases. In addition, the laws of a number of states in the United States that prohibit surcharging have been overturned and certain states have passed or are considering laws to permit surcharging by merchants. Effective October 6, 2022, merchants in Canada (other than in Quebec) are now permitted to surcharge credit card purchases up to a maximum of 2.4 percent as a result of a litigation settlement with Visa and Mastercard. Surcharging is an adverse customer experience and could have a material adverse effect on us, particularly where it only or disproportionately impacts credit card usage or card usage generally, our Card Members or our business. In addition, other steering or differential acceptance practices that are permitted by regulation in some jurisdictions could also have a material adverse effect on us. See \u201cSurcharging or steering by merchants could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations\u201d under \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\n\nIn some countries, governments have established regulatory regimes that require international card networks to be locally licensed and/or to localize aspects of their operations. For example, the Reserve Bank of India, which has broad power under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 2007 to regulate the membership and operations of card networks, issued a mandate requiring payment systems operators in India to store certain payments data locally. In 2021, it imposed restrictions on American Express Banking Corp. from engaging in certain card issuing activities in India, which were lifted in August 2022 following significant investment in technology, infrastructure and resources to comply with the regulation. The development and enforcement of these and other similar laws, regulations and policies may adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and maintain and extend our global network."

Our indebtedness could have important consequences, including:\n\nwas\n\n.\n\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital requirements or capital expenditures;\n\n. exposing us to interest rate risk with respect to the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates;\n\n.\n\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock or make payments in connection with our other obligations;\n\n. impairing our access to the capital markets for debt and equity;\n\n.\n\nrequiring that an increasing portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to the payment of the principal and interest on our thereby reducing funds available for future operations, dividends on our common stock or capital expenditures;\n\n. limiting our ability to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market industry conditions; and\n\n. placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that have less debt.\n\nDuring 2022, we utilized existing sources of liquidity, such as our current cash balances, cash flows from operations and borrowings under our commercial paper program, to meet our short-term liquidity requirements. We believe that existing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. In order to meet our capital expenditure and other operational needs, however, we may be required to borrow additional funds under the revolving credit facility. In the event of a sustained market deterioration, we may need to obtain additional sources of liquidity, which would require us to evaluate available alternatives and take appropriate actions. Moreover, additional borrowings may be required to repay or refinance outstanding indebtedness. Debt maturities and sinking fund payments in 2023, 2024 and 2025 will be $281 million, $476 million and $598 million, respectively. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to access the debt or equity capital markets on favorable terms, if at all, to repay or refinance this debt. Moreover, as new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks we now face could intensify, limiting our ability to repay or refinance existing debt on favorable terms.\n\nWe have in the past entered into, and in the future may enter into, financial derivative instruments, including without limitation, interest rate swaps, forward starting swaps and U.S. Treasury lock agreements. See Item 7A\u2014Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. However, these efforts may not be effective to fully mitigate interest rate risk, and may expose us to other risks and uncertainties, including quarterly \u201cmark to market\u201d valuation risk associated with these instruments, that could negatively and materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nOur ability to pay our expenses and satisfy our debt service obligations depends in significant part on our future performance, which will be affected by the financial, business, economic, competitive, legislative (including tax initiatives and reforms, and other similar legislation or regulation), regulatory and other risk factors described in this section, many of which are beyond our control. If we do not have sufficient cash flows to pay the principal and interest on our outstanding debt, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, reduce capital investments, sell assets, borrow additional funds or sell additional equity. In addition, if our business does not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or if we are unable to incur indebtedness sufficient to enable us to fund our liquidity needs, we may be unable to plan for or respond to changes in our business, which could cause our financial condition, operating results and prospects to be affected materially and adversely.\n\n36",

We base our assumptions, estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material.\n\nOur significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies , of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data , of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Other than our adoption of ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers , in the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we have not made any material changes to our accounting policies or methodologies during the past three fiscal years.

Relocated stores, as well as remodeled, expanded and downsized stores closed more than 14 days, are excluded from the comparable sales calculation until at least 14 full months after reopening. Acquisitions are included in the comparable sales calculation beginning with the first full quarter following the first anniversary of the date of the acquisition. The Canadian brand consolidation, which included the permanent closure of 66 Future Shop stores, the conversion of 65 Future Shop stores to Best Buy stores and the elimination of the Future Shop website, had a material impact on a year-over-year basis on the remaining Canadian retail stores and the website. As such, from the first quarter of fiscal 2016 through the third quarter of fiscal 2017, all Canadian store and website revenue was removed from the comparable sales base and the International segment no longer had a comparable metric. Therefore, Consolidated comparable sales equaled the Domestic segment comparable sales. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we resumed reporting International comparable sales as revenue and the International segment was once again deemed to be comparable and, as such, Consolidated comparable sales are once again equal to the aggregation of Domestic and International comparable sales. Comparable sales also exclude the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2018. On March 1, 2018, we announced our intent to close all of our 257 remaining Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in the U.S. As a result, all revenue related to these stores has been excluded from the comparable sales calculation beginning in March 2018. On October 1, 2018, we acquired all outstanding shares of GreatCall. Consistent with our comparable sales policy, the results of GreatCall are excluded from our comparable sales calculation for fiscal 2019.\n\n(8) The current ratio is calculated by dividing total current assets by total current liabilities.\n\n(9) Includes Best Buy Outlet Centers for all fiscal years presented."

We continue to appropriately balance the need to adjust in response to current industry sales trends with the need to invest so we can capitalize on opportunities as our industry moves through this downturn and returns to expected growth.\n\nOur digital sales in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 comprised 31% of our Domestic revenue, consistent with the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and nearly twice as high as the percentage of Domestic revenue in the pre-pandemic second quarter of fiscal 2020. During these same time periods, the percentage of online sales picked up in our stores by our customers was also consistent at just over 40%. Therefore, we are continuing to adapt our omni-channel capabilities to ensure we maintain a leading position in an increasingly digital age and evolving retail landscape.\n\nWe believe our portfolio of stores needs to provide customers with differentiated experiences and multichannel fulfillment. At the same time, we need them to become more cost and capital efficient to operate while remaining a great place to work. We are on track to deliver our fiscal 2024 store plans, which include closing 20 to 30 large format stores, implementing 8 large format Experience store remodels and expanding the number of Outlet stores to approximately 25 by the end of fiscal 2024.\n\nWe continue to advance our operating model to align with the ongoing evolution of our industry and marketplace trends with two overarching goals in mind \u2014 efficiently allocating our labor cost, considering the channel shift from our physical stores to online, and providing our employees flexibility, predictability and opportunities to gain more skills. We are focused on balancing the amount of labor hours necessary to deliver the best experience possible for our customers and other stakeholders. At the same time, we have been investing in tools, training and employee development programs that increase their flexibility within and across stores. As not all roles, and the associated hourly pay, are the same, we are making the strategic tradeoff decisions necessary to give us the ability to flexibly adjust our labor spending appropriately, particularly customer-facing labor.\n\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we continued to build customer relationships through our membership programs. We successfully launched significant changes to our membership program that we expect will give customers more freedom to choose a membership that fits their technology needs, budget and shopping preferences. In addition, we expect the changes to provide more flexibility to evolve our programs in the future, while resulting in a lower cost to serve than our previous paid membership program, which we have already seen in margin favorability.\n\n15",

This growth has been driven by the increased usage of our credit card, both at and outside of Best Buy, and the favorable credit environment. For fiscal 2024, we expect this profit-sharing revenue to have a relatively neutral impact to our annual gross profit rate compared to last year, as the benefit from the first half of the year is expected to turn to a slight pressure in the second half of the year.\n\nOur SG&A in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 was approximately flat to last year, as higher incentive compensation was primarily offset by lower store payroll expense.\n\nOur SG&A in the first six months of fiscal 2024 decreased primarily due to lower store payroll expense, partially offset by higher incentive compensation",

Bitcoin revenue increased by $4.1 billion, and represented 85% of the increase in total net revenue. Excluding bitcoin revenue, total net revenue increased by $729.0 million, or 17%, in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\n\nTransaction-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $213.9 million or 7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was in line with the increase in GPV of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to and affected by the following events and factors:\n\n+\n\nIn January and February of 2020, we benefited from the growth in payment volume processed by existing sellers, in addition to meaningful contributions from new sellers, compared to the same period in the prior year, which included a benefit from the impact of the leap year;\n\n+ In the second half of March through mid-April, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent shelter-in-place restrictions, we experienced a significant decline in transaction-based revenue, with GPV generated by our Seller business decreasing compared to the prior year;\n\n+ Beginning in mid-April 2020, we started to experience improving trends in GPV generated by our Seller business, as some states started to relax shelter- in-place measures, sellers adapted their businesses to contactless commerce, new sellers joined Square and various government assistance programs led an increase in consumer spending;\n\nIn the third and fourth quarters of 2020, we have experienced positive growth of GPV and revenue compared to the third and fourth quarters of primarily driven by higher priced card-not-present transactions as sellers continued to shift their businesses to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n+\n\nDespite the decrease in transaction-based revenue as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the overall increase in transaction-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the same period in 2019 was primarily driven by growth in higher-priced card-not-present transactions as sellers shifted their businesses to adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the impact from our November 2019 card-present price change, as well as Cash App GPV which includes Cash for Business and peer-to-peer payments sent from a credit card. Cash for Business activity includes peer-to-peer transactions to business accounts using Cash App. The factors and events above had varying impacts on the GPV growth and may continue to impact our revenues in the future. In particular, card- present growth varies by region and product, depending primarily on differences in the timing and phases of reopenings, which we expect will have a significant impact on overall GPV trends.\n\nSubscription and services-based revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 increased by $507.9 million or 49%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. On October 31, 2019, we completed the sale of the Caviar business, and, accordingly, Caviar no longer contributes to subscription and services-based revenue. Excluding Caviar, subscription and services-based revenue grew by $653.9 million, or 74%, in the year ended year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 driven predominantly by Cash App, and to a lesser extent Square Card and Instant Transfers for sellers, partially offset by a decrease in Square Capital loan volumes. Cash App subscription and services-based revenue is primarily comprised of transaction fees from both Cash App Instant Deposit and Cash Card, with a small portion generated from interest earned on customer funds. In an effort to support our sellers, we temporarily suspended charging customers\n\n61",

Such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. Except as described below, we believe,\n\n108\n\nor\n\nTable of Contents\n\nbased upon current information, that the outcome of any such legal proceeding, claim, or government dispute and investigation will not have material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 accident of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. During 2021, we entered into (i) a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice that resolved the Department of Justice\u2019s previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as well as (ii) a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit that resulted in the Company receiving $219 in the second quarter of 2022. In September 2022, we settled a previously disclosed investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the 737 MAX accidents and consented to a civil penalty, which resulted in an earnings charge of $200 that was paid in October 2022. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that we may incur as a result of any remaining pending lawsuits or other matters related to the accidents and the 737 MAX.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial aircraft and services operations of Embraer, of which we were expected to acquire an 80 percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer\u2019s failure to meet certain required closing conditions.

        "BOEING_2022_10K.pdf_page_49": "Program Accounting\n\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long- term production effort for\n\n48\n\nTable of Contents\n\ndelivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.\n\nFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, learning curve, change incorporation, regulatory requirements in connection with certification, flight test and certification schedules, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, inflationary or deflationary trends, and lingering impacts of COVID-19.\n\nTo ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nThe 767, 777X, and 787 programs had near break-even or single digit margins at December 31, 2022. Adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in earnings charges in future periods.\n\n777X Program The 777X program had near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2022. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods, which may be material.\n\n787 Program During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the 787 program primarily due to rework driving longer delivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased the 787 program accounting quantity by 100 units due to the program\u2019s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. The increase in the accounting quantity improved the program\u2019s profit margin.\n\nOur program revenue and cost assumptions reflect our current best estimate. However, if we are required to reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates, experience further delivery delays, incur additional customer considerations, or experience other factors that result lower margins, the 787 program could record additional losses in future periods, which may be material.\n\n49",

The increase in the accounting quantity improved the program\u2019s profit margin.\n\nWe received FAA authorization to resume delivery on July 28, 2022 and deliveries resumed in August. During 2022, we delivered 31 aircraft to customers. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on undelivered aircraft. During 2021, we delivered 14 aircraft between March and May 2021 prior to deliveries being paused in May 2021 due to production quality issues including in our supply chain. We have implemented changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had approximately 100 and 110 aircraft in inventory. Most of the aircraft in inventory at December 31, 2022 are expected to deliver by the end of 2024.\n\nWe are currently producing at low rates and expect to gradually return to 5 per month in 2023. In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that production rates below 5 per month represented abnormally low production rates and result in abnormal production costs. We also determined that the inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs that are required to be expensed as incurred. Cumulative abnormal costs recorded through December 31, 2022 totaled $1.7 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2022 we adjusted the total estimate of abnormal production costs up to $2.8 billion with most being incurred by the end of 2023. At December 31, 2021, we were expecting to incur approximately $2 billion of abnormal production costs on a cumulative basis. The increase was primarily driven by a decision in the fourth quarter of 2022 to slow down near-term production due to supply chain constraints and increased inspection and rework costs. We continue to work with customers and suppliers regarding timing of future deliveries and production rate changes.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework, as well as other actions required to resume 787 deliveries, taking longer than expected. These impacts have resulted in longer than expected delivery delays and associated customer considerations.\n\nFleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial aircraft with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.\n\n33",

In our BCA business, we face aggressive international competition intent on increasing market share. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, shifting acquisition and budget priorities, and continued cost pressure at our U.S. DoD and non-U.S. customers will intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition, and U.S. procurement and compliance requirements that could limit our ability to be cost-competitive in the international market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries.\n\nIn 2022, non-U.S. customers, which includes foreign military sales (FMS), accounted for approximately 41% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks doing business internationally, including:\n\nchanges in regulatory requirements or other executive branch actions, such as Executive Orders;\n\n.\n\n.\n\nchanges in the global trade environment, including disputes with authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including international authorities, that could impact sales and/or delivery of products and services outside the U.S. and/or impose costs on our customers the form of tariffs, duties or penalties attributable to the importation of Boeing products and services;\n\n.\n\nchanges to U.S. and non-U.S. government policies, including sourcing restrictions, requirements to expend a portion of program locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements;\n\n. fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;\n\n.\n\nvolatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead delays or fluctuations in orders;\n\n.\n\nthe complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants;\n\n.\n\nthe uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States;\n\n.\n\nuncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;\n\nimposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions (such as those imposed on Russia) other trade restrictions;\n\n.\n\n.\n\nthe difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;\n\n.\n\ncompliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and\n\n.\n\nunforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.\n\nWhile the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. For example, since 2018, the U.S. and China have imposed tariffs on each other\u2019s imports. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. We are mitigating import costs through Duty Drawback Customs procedures. Overall, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains stalled as economic and national security concerns continue to be a challenge. China is a significant market for commercial aircraft. Boeing has long-standing relationships with our Chinese customers, who represent a key component of our commercial aircraft backlog. For the 737 MAX, there is uncertainty regarding timing of resumption of deliveries in China which is still subject to final regulatory approvals. If we are unable to obtain additional orders from China in the future, our market share could be adversely affected. Furthermore, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, we suspended our operations in Russia due to sanctions and export controls, and the war has negatively impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our business and financial results.

Risk Factors\n\nAn investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. We urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.\n\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\n\nWe depend heavily on commercial airlines, subjecting us to unique risks.\n\nMarket conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft and related services. The commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological advances, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and environmental regulations. Historically, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. Significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally or the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or services, or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. In addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.\n\nWe enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses, which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. Commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. In order to help account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. Our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. Escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. Changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our Commercial Airplanes business.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. In addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nAirlines also are experiencing increased fuel and other costs, and the global economy is experiencing high inflation.\n\nOur Commercial Airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, ensure every airplane in our production system conforms to our exacting specifications, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop and certify new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.\n\nThe commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with U.S and non-U.S. suppliers, highly- skilled labor performed by thousands of employees of ours and other partners, and stringent and evolving regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. The FAA has been working to implement safety reforms such as the 2018 FAA Reauthorization Act and the 2020 Aircraft Certification, Safety and Accountability Act (ACSAA). One of these, section 116 of the ACSAA prohibited the FAA from issuing a type certificate to aircraft after December 27, 2022 unless the aircraft's flight crew alerting system met certain specifications. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were submitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting specifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft must include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in Boeing\u2019s application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning three years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety enhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have provisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material. If we experience delays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Comparable agencies in other countries may adopt similar changes. To the extent the FAA or similar regulatory agencies outside the U.S. implement more stringent regulations, we may incur additional compliance costs. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, certification and production schedules.\n\naddition, we have experienced production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to lower 787 deliveries, including a suspension of 787 deliveries from May 2021 to August 2022. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on built and stored 787 aircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies, including compensation for late deliveries or rights to reject individual airplane deliveries based on delivery delays. Delays on the 737, 777X and 787 programs have resulted in, and may continue to result in, customers having the right to terminate orders, be compensated for late deliveries and/or substitute orders for other Boeing aircraft.",

In our BCA business, we face aggressive international competition intent on increasing market share. In our BDS business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, shifting acquisition and budget priorities, and continued cost pressure at our U.S. DoD and non-U.S. customers will intensify competition for many of our BDS products. Our BGS segment faces competition from many of the same strong U.S. and non-U.S. competitors facing BCA and BDS. Furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition, and U.S. procurement and compliance requirements that could limit our ability to be cost-competitive in the international market. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share.\n\nTable of Contents\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-U.S. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries.\n\nIn 2022, non-U.S. customers, which includes foreign military sales (FMS), accounted for approximately 41% of our revenues. We expect that non-U.S. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. As a result, we are subject to risks doing business internationally, including:\n\nchanges in regulatory requirements or other executive branch actions, such as Executive Orders;\n\n.\n\n.\n\nchanges in the global trade environment, including disputes with authorities in non-U.S. jurisdictions, including international authorities, that could impact sales and/or delivery of products and services outside the U.S. and/or impose costs on our customers the form of tariffs, duties or penalties attributable to the importation of Boeing products and services;\n\n.\n\nchanges to U.S. and non-U.S. government policies, including sourcing restrictions, requirements to expend a portion of program locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements;\n\n. fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;\n\n.\n\nvolatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-U.S. national priorities and budgets, which can lead delays or fluctuations in orders;\n\n.\n\nthe complexity and necessity of using non-U.S. representatives and consultants;\n\n.\n\nthe uncertainty of the ability of non-U.S. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States;\n\n.\n\nuncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;\n\nimposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions (such as those imposed on Russia) other trade restrictions;\n\n.\n\n.\n\nthe difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;\n\n.\n\ncompliance with a variety of non-U.S. laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad; and\n\n.\n\nunforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international tensions and conflicts.\n\nWhile the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future. For example, since 2018, the U.S. and China have imposed tariffs on each other\u2019s imports. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. We are mitigating import costs through Duty Drawback Customs procedures. Overall, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains stalled as economic and national security concerns continue to be a challenge. China is a significant market for commercial aircraft. Boeing has long-standing relationships with our Chinese customers, who represent a key component of our commercial aircraft backlog. For the 737 MAX, there is uncertainty regarding timing of resumption of deliveries in China which is still subject to final regulatory approvals. If we are unable to obtain additional orders from China in the future, our market share could be adversely affected. Furthermore, following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, we suspended our operations in Russia due to sanctions and export controls, and the war has negatively impacted, and could continue to adversely impact, our business and financial results. Impacts from future potential deterioration in trade relations between the U.S. and one or more other countries, could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\n\n10",

We have previously announced plans to adjust production rates on several of our commercial aircraft programs. The 787 program is currently producing at low rates and we expect to gradually increase to 5 per month in 2023. Production of the 777X is currently paused and is expected to resume in 2023. The 737 program has experienced operational and supply chain challenges stabilizing production at 31 per month. We plan to gradually increase 737 production rates based on market demand and supply chain capacity. In addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements and optimizing how we manage inventory. If production rate changes at any of our\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncommercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or create significant disruption to our production system, or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and/or the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.\n\nOperational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in additional production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. Our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. Operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory approval, could result in additional out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nour commercial aircraft fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements and/or potentially required sustainability standards, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. Developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards and/or potentially required sustainability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. These challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. Any failure of any Boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.",

The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to number of factors. These factors include continued production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods.\n\n787 Program During the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased the accounting quantity for the 787 program by 100 units due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. The increase in the accounting quantity improved the program\u2019s profit margin.\n\nWe received FAA authorization to resume delivery on July 28, 2022 and deliveries resumed in August. During 2022, we delivered 31 aircraft to customers. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on undelivered aircraft. During 2021, we delivered 14 aircraft between March and May 2021 prior to deliveries being paused in May 2021 due to production quality issues including in our supply chain. We have implemented changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had approximately 100 and 110 aircraft in inventory. Most of the aircraft in inventory at December 31, 2022 are expected to deliver by the end of 2024.\n\nWe are currently producing at low rates and expect to gradually return to 5 per month in 2023. In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that production rates below 5 per month represented abnormally low production rates and result in abnormal production costs. We also determined that the inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs that are required to be expensed as incurred. Cumulative abnormal costs recorded through December 31, 2022 totaled $1.7 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2022 we adjusted the total estimate of abnormal production costs up to $2.8 billion with most being incurred by the end of 2023. At December 31, 2021, we were expecting to incur approximately $2 billion of abnormal production costs on a cumulative basis. The increase was primarily driven by a decision in the fourth quarter of 2022 to slow down near-term production due to supply chain constraints and increased inspection and rework costs. We continue to work with customers and suppliers regarding timing of future deliveries and production rate changes.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework, as well as other actions required to resume 787 deliveries, taking longer than expected. These impacts have resulted in longer than expected delivery delays and associated customer considerations.\n\nFleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial aircraft with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.\n\n33",

A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long- term production effort for\n\n48\n\nTable of Contents\n\ndelivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.\n\nFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, learning curve, change incorporation, regulatory requirements in connection with certification, flight test and certification schedules, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, inflationary or deflationary trends, and lingering impacts of COVID-19.\n\nTo ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nThe 767, 777X, and 787 programs had near break-even or single digit margins at December 31, 2022. Adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in earnings charges in future periods.\n\n777X Program The 777X program had near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2022. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods, which may be material.\n\n787 Program During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the 787 program primarily due to rework driving longer delivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased the 787 program accounting quantity by 100 units due to the program\u2019s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. The increase in the accounting quantity improved the program\u2019s profit margin.\n\nOur program revenue and cost assumptions reflect our current best estimate. However, if we are required to reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates, experience further delivery delays, incur additional customer considerations, or experience other factors that result lower margins, the 787 program could record additional losses in future periods, which may be material.\n\n49"

For additional information about the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, refer to the heading \u201cLiquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position \u2014 Foreign Exchange\u201d below.\n\nGross Profit Margin\n\nGross profit margin is a ratio calculated by dividing gross profit by net operating revenues. Management believes gross profit margin provides investors with useful information related to the profitability of our business prior to considering all of the operating costs incurred. Management uses this measure in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in evaluating the Company\u2019s performance.\n\nOur gross profit margin increased to 60.3 percent in 2021 from 59.3 percent in 2020. This increase was primarily due to the impact of favorable pricing initiatives and favorable channel and package mix as well as the gradual recovery in away-from-home channels in many markets throughout 2021, partially offset by the impact of increased commodity and transportation\n\n45\n\ncosts. We expect commodity and transportation costs to continue to increase in 2022, and we will continue to proactively take actions in an effort to mitigate the impact of these incremental costs.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\n",

Shipping and handling costs incurred to move goods from our manufacturing locations or sales distribution centers to our customers are also included in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income, except for costs incurred to distribute goods sold by our consolidated bottlers to our customers, which are included in the line item selling, general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of income. Our customers generally do not pay us separately for shipping and handling costs. We recognize the cost of shipping and handling activities that are performed after a customer obtains control of the goods as costs to fulfill our promise to provide goods to the customer. As a result of this election, the Company does not evaluate whether shipping and handling activities are services promised to customers. If revenue is recognized for the related goods before the shipping and handling activities occur, the related costs of those shipping and handling activities are accrued.\n\nSales, Use, Value-Added and Excise Taxes\n\nThe Company collects taxes imposed directly on its customers related to sales, use, value-added, excise and other similar taxes. The Company then remits such taxes on behalf its customers to the applicable governmental authorities. We exclude from net operating revenues the tax amounts imposed on revenue-producing transactions that were collected from our customers to be remitted to governmental authorities. Accordingly, such tax amounts are recorded in the line item trade accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheet when collection of taxes from the customer has not yet occurred and are recorded in the line item accounts payable and accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheet until they are remitted to the applicable governmental authorities. Taxes imposed directly on the Company, whether based on receipts from sales, inventory procurement costs or manufacturing activities, are recorded in the line item cost of goods sold in our consolidated statement of income."

In May 2022, the Company reached the maximum number of shares that could be repurchased under the 2012 Plan and thereby completed the plan. In 2019, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase plan of up to 150 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock.\n\nDuring 2022, the total cash outflow for treasury stock purchases was $1,418 million. The Company repurchased 21.3 million shares of common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors. These shares were repurchased at an average price per share of $62.67, for a total cost of $1,336 million. Since the inception of our share repurchase program in 1984, we have repurchased 3.5 billion shares of our common stock at an average price per share of $17.53. In addition to shares repurchased under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors, the Company\u2019s treasury stock activity also includes shares surrendered to the Company to pay the exercise price and/or to satisfy tax withholding obligations in connection with so-called stock swap exercises of employee stock options and/or the vesting of restricted stock issued to employees. The net impact of the Company\u2019s issuances of stock and share repurchases during 2022 resulted in a net cash outflow of $581 million.\n\nDuring 2021, the Company did not repurchase shares of our common stock under the share repurchase plans authorized by our Board of Directors.\n\nDividends\n\nThe Company paid dividends of $7,616 million and $7,252 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n\nAt its February 2023 meeting, our Board of Directors increased our regular quarterly dividend to $0.46 per share, equivalent to a full year dividend of $1.84 per share in 2023. This is our 61\u201c consecutive annual increase. Our annualized common stock dividend was $1.76 per share and $1.68 per share in 2022 and 2021, respectively.",

Our cash and cash equivalents are held in various locations throughout the world and are generally unrestricted. We utilize a variety of strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. At December 31, 2020, approximately 82% of the consolidated amount was held outside of United States.\n\nCorning also has a commercial paper program pursuant to which we may issue short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount outstanding at any one time of $1.5 billion. Under this program, the Company may issue the paper time to time and will use the proceeds for general corporate purposes. The Company\u2019s Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support obligations under the commercial paper program, if needed. At December 31, 2020, Corning did not have outstanding commercial paper.\n\nThe Company\u2019s $1.5 billion Revolving Credit Agreement is available to support its commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes.\n\nShare Repurchases\n\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company repurchased 4.1 million and 31.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, on the open market for approximately $105 million and $925 million as part of its 2018 Repurchase Program. The Company suspended share buybacks during the first quarter of 2020 and made no share repurchases for the remainder of the year.\n\nRefer to Note 17 (Shareholders\u2019 Equity) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nOther\n\nWe complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing their financial strength at least annually or more frequently for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk. We closely monitor payments and developments to identify potential customer credit issues. From time to time, we factor or sell accounts receivable. Sales of accounts receivable during 2020 were $402 million, which we believe would have been collected during the normal course of business this year. During 2019, Corning participated in customer-initiated payment programs which resulted in accelerated collections of $143 million in accounts receivable. We currently have not identified any potential material impact on our liquidity resulting from customer credit issues.\n\nOur major source of funding for 2021 and beyond will be our operating cash flow, our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and proceeds from any issuances of debt. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund operations, acquisitions, capital expenditures, scheduled debt repayments, dividend payments and share repurchase programs.\n\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement includes affirmative and negative covenants with which we must comply, including a leverage (debt to capital ratio) financial covenant. The required leverage ratio is a maximum of 60%. At December 31, 2020, our leverage using this measure was approximately 37%. As of December 31, 2020, Corning was in compliance and no amounts were outstanding under the Company\u2019s Revolving Credit Agreement.\n\nOur debt instruments contain customary event of default provisions, which allow the lenders the option of accelerating all obligations upon occurrence of certain events. In addition, some of our debt instruments contain a cross default provision, whereby an uncured default exceeding a specified amount on one debt obligation of the Company, also would be considered a default under the terms of another debt instrument. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all such provisions.\n\nManagement is not aware of any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in or that are reasonably likely to result in a material decrease in our liquidity. In addition, other than items discussed, there are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in our capital resources and no expected material changes in the mix and relative cost of such resources.\n\n44"

These amounts were reflected within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nThe impact to income was primarily driven by Japanese yen, South Korean won and euro-denominated hedges of translated earnings.\n\n(2)\n\nIncome Before Income Taxes\n\nThe translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, including the impact of hedges realized in the current year, adversely impacted Corning\u2019s income before income taxes by $142 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, when compared to the same period in 2021.\n\nProvision for Income Taxes\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following:\n\n+ Anet provision of $67 million due to changes in tax reserves;\n\n+ Anet provision of $40 million due to differences arising from foreign earnings; and\n\n+\n\nAnet provision of $38 million due to changes in valuation allowance assessments, offset by\n\n+ Anet benefit of $60 million due to tax credits; and\n\nAnet benefit of $49 million due to foreign derived intangible income.\n\n+\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following:\n\n+ Anet benefit of $62 million due to tax credits; and\n\n+ Annet benefit of $37 million related to share-based compensation payments, offset by\n\n+\n\nAnet provision of $52 million due to differences arising from foreign earnings, including the impact of intercompany asset sales.\n\nThe U.S. enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (\u201cIRA\u201d) in August 2022, which, among other sections, creates a new book minimum tax of at least 15% of consolidated pre-tax income for corporations with average book income in excess of $1 billion. This provision of the IRA will first apply to the Company in 2024. We expect the IRA to have a material impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we are currently evaluating the various credits available under IRA and its impact to Corning\u2019s financial position and results of operations, including the effective tax rate.",

In addition, cash used in investing activities reflected the following activity: * \u2014 Gross capital expenditures remained relatively consistent at approximately $2.7 billion and $2.5 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022, approximately 73% of the Company\u2019s total capital expenditures were for technology, digital and other strategic initiatives and 27% were for store, fulfillment and support facilities expansion and improvements.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities decreased to $10.5 billion in 2022 compared to $11.4 billion in 2021.

The Company has been cooperating with the government providing documents and information in response to these CIDs.\n\nand\n\nIn May 2017, the Company received a CID from the SDNY requesting documents and information concerning possible false claims submitted to Medicare in connection with reimbursements for prescription drugs under the Medicare Part D program. The Company has been cooperating with the government and providing documents and information in response to this CID.\n\nStockholder Matters\n\nBeginning in February 2019, multiple class action complaints, as well as a derivative complaint, were filed by putative plaintiffs against the Company and certain current and former officers and directors. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action under federal securities laws that are premised on allegations that the defendants made certain omissions and misrepresentations relating to the performance of the Company\u2019s LTC business unit. The Company and its current and former officers and directors are defending themselves against these claims. Since filing, several of the cases have been consolidated, and the first-filed federal case, City of Miami Fire Fighters\u2019 and Police Officers\u2019 Retirement Trust, et al. (formerly known as Anarkat), was dismissed with prejudice in February 2021. Plaintiffs appealed that decision to the First Circuit after their motion for reconsideration was denied, and in August 2022 the First Circuit affirmed the dismissal. In re CVS Health Corp. Securities Act Litigation (formerly known as Waterford) and In re CVS Health Corp. Securities Litigation (formerly known as City of Warren and Freundlich) have been stayed pending the outcome of the First Circuit appeal. Plaintiffs in both cases have since filed amended complaints, which the Company has moved to dismiss.\n\nIn August and September 2020, two class actions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d) were filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut against CVS Health, Aetna, and several current and former executives, directors and/or members of Aetna\u2019s Compensation and Talent Management Committee: Radcliffe v. Aetna Inc., et al. and Flaim v. Aetna Inc., et al. The plaintiffs in these cases assert a variety of causes of action premised on allegations that the defendants breached fiduciary duties and engaged in prohibited transactions relating to participants in the Aetna 401(k) Plan\u2019s investment in company stock between December 3, 2017 and February 20, 2019, claiming losses related to the performance of the Company\u2019s LTC business unit. The district court consolidated the actions, and in October 2021, dismissed the consolidated action without prejudice. Plaintiffs filed an amended consolidated complaint, which the Company moved to dismiss. In October 2022, the court granted the Company\u2019s motion to dismiss with prejudice. Plaintiffs have appealed this decision to the Second Circuit. The Company also received a related document request pursuant to ERISA \u00a7 104(b), to which the Company has responded. The Company and its current and former officers and directors are defending themselves against these claims.\n\nIn December 2021, the Company received a demand for inspection of books and records pursuant to Delaware Corporation Law Section 220 (the \u201cDemand\u201d). The Demand purports to be related to potential breaches of fiduciary duties by the Board in relation to certain matters concerning opioids.\n\nThe Company is also a party to other legal proceedings and is subject to government investigations, inquiries and audits and has received and is cooperating with the government in response to CIDs, subpoenas, or similar process from various governmental agencies requesting information. These other legal proceedings and government actions include claims of or relating to bad faith, medical or professional malpractice, breach of fiduciary duty, claims processing, dispensing of medications, non-compliance with state and federal regulatory regimes, marketing misconduct, denial of or failure to timely or appropriately pay or administer claims and benefits, provider network structure (including the use of performance-based networks and termination of provider contracts), rescission of insurance coverage, improper disclosure or use of personal information, anticompetitive practices, general contractual matters, product liability, intellectual property litigation, and employment litigation. Some of\n\n175\n\nthese other legal proceedings are or are purported to be class actions or derivative claims. The Company is defending itself against the claims brought in these matters.\n\nAwards to the Company and others of certain government contracts, particularly Medicaid contracts and other contracts with government customers in the Company\u2019s Health Care Benefits segment, frequently are subject to protests by unsuccessful bidders. These protests may result in awards to the Company being reversed, delayed, or modified. The loss or delay in implementation of any government contract could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. The Company will continue to defend contract awards it receives.\n\nThere also continues to be a heightened level of review and/or audit by regulatory authorities and legislators of, and increased litigation regarding, the Company\u2019s and the rest of the health care and related benefits industry\u2019s business and reporting practices, including premium rate increases, utilization management, development and application of medical policies, complaint, grievance and appeal processing, information privacy, provider network structure (including provider network adequacy, the use of performance-based networks and termination of provider contracts), provider directory accuracy, calculation of minimum medical loss ratios and/or payment of related rebates, delegated arrangements, rescission of insurance coverage, limited benefit health products, student health products, pharmacy benefit management practices (including manufacturers\u2019 rebates, pricing, the use of narrow networks and the placement of drugs in formulary tiers), sales practices, customer service practices, vendor oversight, and claim payment practices (including payments to out-of-network providers).\n\nAs a leading national health solutions company, the Company regularly is the subject of government actions of the types described above. These government actions may prevent or delay the Company from implementing planned premium rate increases and may result, and have resulted, in restrictions on the Company\u2019s businesses, changes to or clarifications of the Company\u2019s business practices, retroactive adjustments to premiums, refunds or other payments to members, beneficiaries, states or the federal government, withholding of premium payments to the Company by government agencies, assessments of damages, civil or criminal fines or penalties, or other sanctions, including the possible suspension or loss of licensure and/or suspension or exclusion from participation in government programs.\n\nThe Company can give no assurance that its businesses, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows will not be materially adversely affected, or that the Company will not be required to materially change its business practices, based on: (i) future enactment of new health care or other laws or regulations; (ii) the interpretation or application of existing laws or regulations as they may relate to one or more of the Company\u2019s businesses, one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally; (iii) pending or future federal or state government investigations of one or more of the Company\u2019s businesses, one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally; (iv) pending or future government audits, investigations or enforcement actions against the Company; (v) adverse developments in any pending qui tam lawsuit against the Company, whether sealed or unsealed, or in any future qui tam lawsuit that may be filed against the Company; or (vi) adverse developments in pending or future legal proceedings against the Company or affecting one or more of the industries in which the Company competes and/or the health care industry generally.",
        "CVSHEALTH_2022_10K.pdf_page_172": "Usual and Customary Pricing Litigation\n\nThe Company and certain current and former directors and officers are named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits that allege that the Company\u2019s retail pharmacies overcharged for prescription drugs by not submitting the correct usual and customary price during the claims adjudication process. These actions are brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs, including plan members, private payors, government payors, and shareholders based on different legal theories. Some of these cases are brought as putative class actions, and in some instances, classes have been certified. In October 2022, one of the litigating shareholders made a litigation demand to the Board related to these and other issues after his amended derivative complaint was dismissed for failing to demonstrate demand futility. The Company is defending itself against these claims.\n\nPBM Litigation and Investigations\n\nThe Company is named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is subject to a number of investigations concerning its PBM practices.\n\nThe Company is facing multiple lawsuits, including by state Attorneys General, governmental subdivisions and several putative class actions, regarding drug pricing and its rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers. These complaints, brought by a number of different types of plaintiffs under a variety of legal theories, generally allege that rebate agreements between the drug manufacturers and PBMs caused inflated prices for certain drug products. The Company is defending itself against these claims. The Company has also received subpoenas, civil investigative demands (\u201cCIDs\u201d), and other requests for documents and information from, and is being investigated by, the FTC and Attorneys General of several states and the District of Columbia regarding its PBM practices, including pricing and rebates. The Company has been providing documents and information in response to these subpoenas, CIDs, and requests for information.\n\nUnited States ex rel. Behnke v. CVS Caremark Corporation, et al. (U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania). In April 2018, the Court unsealed a complaint filed in February 2014. The government has declined to intervene in this case. The relator alleges that the Company submitted, or caused to be submitted, to Part D of the Medicare program Prescription Drug Event data and/or Direct and Indirect Remuneration reports that misrepresented true prices paid by the Company\u2019s PBM to pharmacies for drugs dispensed to Part D beneficiaries with prescription benefits administered by the Company\u2019s PBM. The Company is defending itself against these claims.\n\n171\n\nControlled Substances Litigation, Audits and Subpoenas\n\nIn December 2017, the U.S. Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated numerous cases filed against various defendants by plaintiffs such as counties, cities, hospitals, Indian tribes and third-party payors, alleging claims beginning as far back as the early 2000s generally concerning the impacts of widespread prescription opioid abuse. The consolidated multidistrict litigation captioned In re National Prescription Opiate Litigation (MDL No. 2804) is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. This multidistrict litigation presumptively includes hundreds of relevant federal court cases that name the Company as a defendant. A significant number of similar cases that name the Company as a defendant in some capacity are pending in state courts.\n\nIn addition, the Company has been named as a defendant in similar cases brought by certain state Attorneys General. The Company is defending itself against all such claims. Additionally, the Company has received subpoenas, CIDs, and/or other requests for information regarding opioids from state Attorneys General and insurance and other regulators of several U.S. jurisdictions. The Company has been cooperating with the government with respect to these subpoenas, CIDs, and other requests for information.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company was among the chain pharmacies found liable by a jury in a trial in federal court in Ohio; in August 2022, the court issued a judgment jointly against the three defendants in the amount of $651 million to be paid over 15 years, and also ordered certain injunctive relief. The Company is appealing the judgment and has not accrued a liability for this matter. In March 2022, CVS Health Corporation and CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into a settlement agreement with the State of Florida to resolve claims related to opioid medications dating back more than a decade. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, CVS Health Corporation settled all opioid claims against it and its subsidiaries by the State of Florida for $484 million, which is to be paid over a period of 18 years. During the three months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $484 million liability associated with this legal settlement. In August 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of New Mexico to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of New Mexico and participating subdivisions. In September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the State of West Virginia to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the State of West Virginia and participating subdivisions. Also in September 2022, CVS Pharmacy, Inc. entered into an agreement with the Cherokee Nation to settle all opioid claims against it and its parents and subsidiaries by the Cherokee Nation.\n\nIn December 2022, the Company agreed to a formal settlement agreement, the financial amounts of which were agreed to in principle in October 2022, with a leadership group of a number of state Attorneys General and the Plaintiffs\u2019 Executive Committee (\u201cPEC\u201d). The agreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by states and political subdivisions, but not private plaintiffs. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the settlement would be approximately $4.3 billion in opioid remediation and $625 million in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs and additional remediation. The amounts would be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The agreement also contains injunctive terms relating to the dispensing of opioid medications. The settlement agreement is available at nationalopioidsettlement.com.\n\nUnder the settlement agreement, before the Company determines whether to enter into any final settlement, it will assess the number and identities of the governmental entities that will participate in any such settlement. The settlement agreement contemplates that if certain governmental entities do not agree to the settlement, but the Company nonetheless concludes that there is sufficient participation to warrant going forward with the settlement, there would be a corresponding reduction in the amount due from the Company to account for the governmental entities that did not agree. Those non-participating governmental entities would be entitled to pursue their claims against the Company and other defendants. Private plaintiff litigation will also continue.\n\nThe Company has been informed that 45 states, the District of Columbia, and all eligible United States territories have elected to join the settlement. Three states were the subject of earlier settlements. The Company has elected to proceed with the settlement process based on that level of participation. The settlement process will progress to the period during which subdivisions may elect to join.\n\nIn December 2022, the Company also agreed to a formal settlement agreement with a leadership group representing tribes throughout the United States. The agreement would resolve substantially all opioid claims against Company entities by such tribes. The maximum amount payable by the Company under the settlement would be $113 million in opioid remediation and $18 million in attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. The amounts would be payable over 10 years, beginning in 2023. The agreement is contingent upon sufficient participation by tribes.\n\n172\n\nThe Company has concluded that settlement of opioid claims by governmental entities and tribes is probable, and the loss related thereto could be reasonably estimated. As a result of that conclusion, and its assessment of certain other opioid-related claims including those for which the Company reached agreement in August and September 2022, the Company recorded pre-tax charges of $5.2 billion and $99 million during the three months ended September 30, 2022 and the three months ended December 31, 2022, respectively, of which $4.8 billion was recorded in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. In addition, the Company expects the cash impact in 2023 and 2024 to be less than $500 million in each year. Because loss contingencies are inherently unpredictable and unfavorable developments or resolutions can occur, the assessment requires judgments about future events. Moreover, the settlement is in its early phases, and there is no assurance that contingencies will be satisfied. The amount of ultimate loss may differ materially from this accrual.\n\nBecause of the many uncertainties associated with any settlement arrangement or other resolution of all opioid-related litigation matters, including the uncertain scope of participation by governmental entities, and given that the Company continues to actively defend ongoing litigation for which it believes it has defenses and assertions that have merit, the Company is not able to reasonably estimate the range of ultimate possible loss for all opioid-related litigation matters at this time. The outcome of these legal matters could have a material effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and/or cash flows.\n\nIn January 2020, the DOJ served the Company with a DEA administrative subpoena. The subpoena seeks documents relating to practices with respect to prescription opioids and other controlled substances at CVS pharmacy locations concerning potential violations of the federal Controlled Substances Act and the federal False Claims Act. In January 2022, the DOJ served the Company with a CID regarding similar subjects, and the Company is providing documents and information in response to these matters.",

The opioid litigation charges are reflected within the Corporate/Other segment.\n\n6) In 2022, the loss on assets held for sale relates to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. The Company continually evaluates its portfolio for non-strategic assets. The Company determined that its LTC business was no longer a strategic asset and during the third quarter of 2022 committed to a plan to sell the LTC business. As of September 30, 2022, the LTC business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and the net assets were accounted for as assets held for sale. The carrying value of the LTC business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and a loss on assets held for sale was recorded during the third quarter of 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the net assets of the LTC business continued to meet the criteria for held-for-sale accounting and during the fourth quarter of 2022, an incremental loss on assets held for sale was recorded to write down the carrying value of the LTC business to its estimated fair value less costs to sell. During 2022, the loss on assets held for sale also relates to the Commercial Business reporting unit within the Health Care Benefits segment. In March 2022, the Company reached an agreement to sell its international health care business domiciled in Thailand (\u201cThailand business\u201d), which was included in the Commercial Business reporting unit. At that time, a portion of the Commercial Business goodwill was specifically allocated to the Thailand business. The net assets of the Thailand business were accounted for as assets held sale at March 31, 2022. The carrying value of the Thailand business was determined to be greater than its estimated fair value less costs to sell and a loss on assets held for sale was recorded\n\nduring the first quarter of 2022. The sale of the Thailand business closed in the second quarter of 2022, and the ultimate loss on the sale was not material.\n\nIn 2021 and 2020, acquisition-related integration costs relate to the Company\u2019s acquisition (the \u201cAetna Acquisition\u201d) of Aetna Inc.

For example, in December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld an Arkansas law that, among other things, mandates a particular pricing methodology, establishes an appeals process for a pharmacy when the reimbursement is below the pharmacy\u2019s acquisition cost, permits a pharmacy to reverse and rebill if they cannot procure the drug from its wholesaler at a price equal to or less than the reimbursement rate, prohibits a PBM from reimbursing a pharmacy less than the amount it reimburses an affiliate on a per unit basis, and permits a pharmacy to decline to dispense if the reimbursement is lower than the pharmacy\u2019s acquisition cost. Subsequently, in November 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld a North Dakota law that regulates employer-sponsored ERISA health plans and certain PBM practices within Medicare and in April 2022 the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma affirmed that the Oklahoma Insurance Department could enforce a state law against PBMs that contained provisions that alter and limit some of the options that an ERISA plan can use, because none of the provisions mandate that ERISA plans make any specific choices.

Accordingly, our fiscal 2020 results include 13 months of Pet segment results compared to 12 months in fiscal 2019. The impact of this change was not material to our consolidated results of operations and, therefore, we did not restate prior period financial statements for comparability.

The $869 million increase was primarily driven by an $801 million change in current assets and liabilities and a $425 million increase in net earnings, partially offset by a $192 million change in non-cash restructuring, impairment, and other exit costs and a $123 million change in deferred income taxes. The $801 million change in current assets and liabilities was primarily driven by a $233 million change in other current liabilities, primarily driven by changes in income taxes payable, trade and advertising accruals, and incentive accruals, a $230 million change in accounts payable as a result of increased spending on raw materials and packaging as well as the continued extension of payment terms, and a $208 million change in prepaid and other current assets, primarily driven by the timing of certain tax payments and receipts.\n\nWe strive to grow core working capital at or below the rate of growth in our net sales. For fiscal 2020, core working capital decreased $591 million, compared to a net sales increase of 5 percent, primarily driven by the increase in accounts payable and lower inventory balances.

The increase in depreciation expense caused by updating the salvage value and shortening the useful life of depreciable fixed assets to coincide with the end of production under an approved restructuring plan, but only if impairment is not present.\n\nAOCTL. Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nAdjusted diluted EPS. Diluted EPS adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA.

Operating profit adjusted for certain items affecting year-to-year comparability, divided by net sales.\n\nConstant currency. Financial results translated to United States dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. To present this information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are translated into United States dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year, rather than the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. Therefore, the foreign currency impact is equal to current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year.\n\nCore working capital. Accounts receivable plus inventories less accounts payable, all as of the last day of our fiscal year.\n\nCOVID-19.

The calculation of earnings before income taxes and after-tax earnings from joint ventures, net interest, depreciation and amortization.\n\nEuribor. European Interbank Offered Rate.\n\nFair value hierarchy. For purposes of fair value measurement, we categorize assets and liabilities into one of three levels based on the assumptions (inputs) used in valuing the asset or liability. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, while Level 3 generally requires significant management judgment. The three levels are defined as follows:\n\nLevel 1: | Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n\nLevel 2: | Observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets or quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in inactive markets.\n\nLevel 3: | Unobservable inputs reflecting management\u2019s assumptions about the inputs used in pricing the asset or liability.\n\nFocus 6 platforms.

Gross domestic product.\n\n95\n\nGenerally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Guidelines, procedures, and practices that we are required to use in recording and reporting accounting information in our financial statements.\n\nGoodwill.

Net sales less cost of sales.\n\nHedge accounting. Accounting for qualifying hedges that allows changes in a hedging instrument\u2019s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period. Hedge accounting is permitted for certain hedging instruments and hedged items only if the hedging relationship is highly effective, and only prospectively from the date a hedging relationship is formally documented.\n\nHolistic Margin Management (HMM).

London Interbank Offered Rate.\n\nMark-to-market. The act of determining a value for financial instruments, commodity contracts, and related assets or liabilities based on the current market price for that item.\n\nNet debt. Long-term debt, current portion of long-term debt, and notes payable, less cash and cash equivalents.\n\nNet debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio.

The amount of revenue received for shipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\n\nInventories\n\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\n\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\n\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be assessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2022 in the fiscal fourth quarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-process research and development could be written off or partially impaired depending on the underlying program.\n\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed for impairment when warranted by economic conditions.

Markets consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets businesses.\n\n(b)\n\nComparisons noted in the sections below are for the second quarter of 2023 versus the second quarter of 2022, unless otherwise specified.\n\nFirmwide overview\n\nFor the second quarter of 2023, JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $14.5 billion, up 67%, earnings per share of $4.75, ROE of 20% and ROTCE of 25%. The Firm's results for the second quarter of 2023 included an estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion in Corporate and a net addition to the allowance for credit losses of $1.2 billion associated with the First Republic acquisition. The Firm's results also included investment securities losses of $900 million in Treasury and CIO.\n\nbalances. Net interest income excluding Markets was $22.4 billion, up 63%.\n\nNoninterest revenue was $19.5 billion, up 25%, driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition, higher Markets noninterest revenue and the absence of losses on equity investments in Payments in the prior year, partially offset by higher net investment securities losses in Treasury and ClO. The impact of the First Republic acquisition included a $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain in Corporate.\n\n- Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower Markets NII, largely offset by higher NIR.\n\n* Total net revenue was $41.3 billion, up 34%, reflecting:\n\n- Net interest income of $21.8 billion, up 44%, driven by higher rates and, to a lesser extent, the impact of the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and lower average deposit\n\nNoninterest expense was $20.8 billion, up 11%, driven by higher compensation expense due to additional headcount and the impact of wage inflation, $599 million expense associated with the First Republic acquisition, higher technology and marketing investments and higher legal expense.\n\n* The provision for credit losses was $2.9 billion, reflecting a $1.5 billion net addition to the allowance for credit losses and $1.4 billion of net charge-offs. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments. The net addition also reflected:\n\n- $233 million in consumer predominantly in Card Services, and\n\n- $79 million in wholesale reflecting $389 million in CB, largely offset by a $243 million reduction in Corporate.\n\nNet charge-offs increased $754 million, predominantly driven by CCB, primarily Card Services, as 30+ day delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nhe prior year included a $428 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $657 million.\n\n* The total allowance for credit losses was $24.3 billion at une 30, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses \u20180 retained loans coverage ratio of 1.75%, compared with 1.69% in the prior year.\n\n* The Firm\u2019s nonperforming assets totaled $7.8 billion at une 30, 2023, relatively flat from the prior year, as lower consumer nonaccrual loans due to loan sales in the prior year were offset by higher wholesale nonaccrual loans, reflecting client-specific downgrades. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 70-79 for additional information.\n\n+ Firmwide average loans of $1.2 trillion were up 13%, driven by higher loans in CCB and CB, largely as a result of the First Republic acquisition.\n\n+ Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were down 6%, driven by:\n\n- the continued migration into higher-yielding investments in AWM; declines in CIB and CB primarily due to continued deposit attrition, which for CIB included actions to reduce certain deposits; and a net decline in CCB primarily from existing accounts due to increased customer spending,",

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s HQLA was further impacted by a reduction in cash primarily driven by higher average loans, a dividend payment to the Parent Company, and a decline in average deposits.\n\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2023 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\u2019s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from a decline in average deposits and joan growth, as well as lower market values of HQLA- eligible investment securities and the impact of the First Republic acquisition.\n\nRefer to Note 10 and Note 28 for additional information on he Firm's investment securities portfolio and the First Republic acquisition.\n\nActions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor behavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits, including those held by the Firm. Each of the Firm and PMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate rom period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the continued impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors.\n\nRefer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 2022 Form 10-K and he Firm\u2019s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows."

Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. Cash used in operating activities was $1.5 billion in 2020 compared to cash provided by operating activities of $1.8 billion in 2019. Operating cash flows were significantly negatively impacted by the temporary closures at our properties and hotels, travel restrictions to Macau, and other operational restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, as discussed above, and triple-net operating lease rent payments, partially offset by an increase in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates primarily received from the MGP BREIT Venture and a decrease in cash paid for interest, as discussed in \u201cNon-operating Results.\u201d In addition to the decrease in our operating results across all properties, the current year period was negatively affected by a change in working capital primarily related to a decrease in accrued expenses, partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable, each of which were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, discussed above, and the settlement of the October | litigation. The prior year period was negatively affected by a change in working capital, primarily related to gaming deposits.\n\nInvesting activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.\n\nCash provided by investing activities decreased to $2.2 billion in 2020 from $3.5 billion in 2019. The change was due primarily to $2.5 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of the real estate of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas in the current year compared to $4.2 billion of proceeds received related to the sale of Bellagio and $652 million of proceeds received related to the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land that was partially offset by a $536 million outflow for the acquisition of Empire City in the prior year, and a decrease of $468 million in capital expenditures, partially offset by a $37 million decrease in distributions from unconsolidated affiliates. In the current year period, distributions from unconsolidated affiliates included $51 million related to our share of a distribution received from CityCenter. In the prior year period, distributions from unconsolidated affiliates included $90 million related to our share of a distribution received from CityCenter. The decrease in capital expenditures primarily reflects our efforts to reduce or defer planned domestic capital expenditures as we mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our liquidity, and the substantial completion of our MGM Springfield development project, the rebranding at Park MGM, and the expansion of the convention center at MGM Grand Las Vegas in the prior year, as discussed in further detail below."

In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments.\n\nas\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $5.9 billion, of which MGM China held $860 million. In addition to the cash and cash equivalents, MGM China also had approximately $124 million of restricted cash.\n\nAt December 31, 2022, we had $8.8 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $1.2 billion outstanding under MGM China\u2019s first revolving credit facility and $224 million outstanding under MGM China\u2019s second revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility. We have $1.3 billion of debt maturing in the next twelve months, which we expect to repay with cash on hand.\n\nDue to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2022, MGM China further amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility to extend the financial covenant waivers through maturity in May 2024.\n\nOur estimated cash interest payments, based on principal amounts of debt outstanding and the contractual maturity dates and interest rates as of December 31, 2022, for 2023, 2024, and 2025 are approximately $230 million, $190 million, and $145 million, respectively, excluding MGM China, and approximately $480 million, $355 million, and $235 million, respectively, on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China.\n\nWe are also required as of December 31, 2022 to make annual cash rent payments of $1.7 billion over the next twelve months under triple-net lease agreements, which triple-net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent. See Note 11 for discussion of our leases and lease obligations.\n\nWe have planned capital expenditures in 2023 of approximately $795 million to $835 million domestically, which is inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the respective domestic properties, and an estimate of approximately $110 million to $150 million at MGM China. Refer to Note 12 for discussion of MGM Grand Paradise\u2019s commitment to investment in gaming and non-gaming projects and the development of international tourist markets as well as other contractual obligations pursuant to its gaming concession. The estimated amount of the investment for 2023 that relates to capital projects is included within the capital expenditure amounts above.\n\nWe additionally have planned contributions to BetMGM in 2023 of approximately $75 million. We continue to explore potential development or investment opportunities, such as a commercial gaming facility in New York and our venture in Japan, which may require cash commitments in the future.\n\nWe also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plans. Subsequent to December 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately 6 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $38.12 per share for an aggregate amount of $210 million. Repurchased shares were retired. On February 8, 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors has determined to suspend the ongoing dividends in light of our current preferred method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. To the extent we determine to reinstate the dividend in the future, determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\n\n46",

We believe that there is strong momentum in our business and our 2023 outlook remains bright, driven by a robust events calendar domestically, MGM China\u2019s rapid year-to- date return to profitability and BetMGM's ongoing improvement in 2023.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe achieved exceptional results in the fourth quarter and remain optimistic in our outlook for this year. We are also focused on free cash flow and believe our company presents a compelling yield, especially when taking into account the value in our share price for excess cash, our ownership value of MGM China and BetMGM,\u201d said Jonathan Halkyard, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer of MGM Resorts. \u201cOur share buyback program continues to return capital to shareholders as we have already repurchased 4 million shares for $164 million year-to-date, adding to the 76 million shares we repurchased in 2022 and totaling approximately $4.7 billion since 2021.

        "MGMRESORTS_2023Q2_10Q.pdf_page_35": "Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nCash Flows\n\nOperating activities. Trends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, and tax payments or refunds. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.3 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $933 million in the prior year period. The change from the prior year period was due primarily to the increase in Adjusted Property EBITDAR at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and MGM China discussed within the Results of Operations section above, a decrease in working capital primarily related to collection of receivables, and a decrease in cash paid for interest, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments and the change in cash paid (refunded) for taxes, net.\n\nInvesting activities. Our investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms.\n\nCash used in investing activities was $59 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $2.2 billion in the prior year period. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we received $447 million in net cash related to the sale of the operations of Gold Strike Tunica, received $153 million in cash related to the principal portion of the Circus Circus Las Vegas note receivable that was repaid, made payments of $393 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, contributed $50 million to BetMGM, and made $216 million in net investments in debt securities. In comparison, in the prior year period we received $4.4 billion in net cash proceeds related to the VICI\n\n34\n\nis\n\nTransaction, which were partially offset by net cash paid of $1.6 billion to acquire The Cosmopolitan, payments of $237 million in capital expenditures, as further discussed below, and contributed $150 million to BetMGM.\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nWe made capital expenditures of $393 million in the six months ended June 30, 2023, of which $20 million related to MGM China and is inclusive of capital expenditures relating to the gaming concession investment. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and corporate and other entities of $373 million primarily related to expenditures in information technology, room remodels, and convention center remodels.\n\nWe made capital expenditures of $237 million in the six months ended June 30, 2022, of which $16 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $221 million primarily related to expenditures in information technology and room remodels.\n\nFinancing activities. Cash used in financing activities was $3.3 billion in the six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to $2.5 billion in the prior year period. In the six months ended June 30, 2023, we had net repayments of debt of $2.0 billion, as further discussed below, distributed $162 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and repurchased $1.1 billion of our common stock. In comparison, in the prior year period, we had net repayments of debt of $162 million, as further discussed below, distributed $206 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and repurchased $2.1 billion of our common stock.\n\nBorrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, we had net repayments of debt of $2.0 billion, which consisted of the repayment of $1.25 billion of aggregate principal amount of our 6% senior notes due 2023 upon maturity and aggregate net repayments of $758 million on MGM China\u2019s revolving credit facilities.\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022, we had net repayments of debt of $162 million, which consisted of the repayment of $1.0 billion of aggregate principal amount of our 7.75% senior notes due 2022, net draws of $40 million on MGP OP\u2019s revolving credit facility, and net borrowings of $798 million on MGM China\u2019s first revolving credit facility to fund an increase in share capital of MGM Grand Paradise pursuant to the capital requirements under the new Macau gaming law and for general corporate purposes.\n\nDividends, Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners, and Share Repurchases\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2023, we paid $1.1 billion relating to repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans. See Note 11 for further information on the stock repurchases. In connection with those repurchases, the March 2022 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was completed. In February 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors authorized a $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan. The remaining availability under the February 2023 $2.0 billion stock repurchase plan was $1.4 billion as of June 30, 2023.\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased and retired $2.1 billion of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase plans.\n\nDuring the six months ended June 30, 2022, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share in March and June 2022, totaling $2 million and MGP OP paid $283 million of distributions to its partnership unit holders, of which we received $117 million and MGP received $166 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.\n\nOther Factors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash\n\nWe require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our businesses. In addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments.\n\n35\n\nOn February 8, 2023, we announced that the Board of Directors has determined to suspend the ongoing dividends in light of our current preferred method of returning value to shareholders through our share repurchase plan. To the extent we determine to reinstate the dividend in the future, determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, we had cash and cash equivalents of $3.8 billion, of which MGM China held $448 million, and we had $6.7 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $708 million outstanding under MGM China\u2019s first revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our revolving credit facility or MGM China\u2019s second revolving credit facility. In June 2023, MGM China amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility, which extended the maturity date of each facility to May 2026, increased the amount to which MGM China may upsize its second revolving credit facility, removed the requirement for the MGM China first revolving credit facility to be fully drawn prior to utilizing the MGM China second revolving credit facility, and extended the financial covenant waivers through December 31, 2024.\n\nAs of June 30, 2023, our expected cash interest payments over the next twelve months are approximately $180 million to $190 million, excluding MGM China, and approximately $395 million to $405 million on a consolidated basis, which includes MGM China.\n\nWe are required, as of June 30, 2023, to make annual cash rent payments of $1.7 billion over the next twelve months under triple-net lease agreements, which triple-net leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent. See Note 8 for discussion of our leases and lease obligations.\n\nWe have planned capital expenditures expected over the remainder of 2023 of approximately $450 million to $460 million domestically, which is inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the respective domestic properties, and an estimate of approximately $50 million to $80 million at MGM China, which is inclusive of the estimated amount of the gaming concession investment for 2023 that relates to capital projects.\n\nWe continue to explore potential development or investment opportunities, such as expanding our global online gaming presence and pursuing commercial gaming facility in New York, which may require cash commitments in the future. Additionally, we expect to have cash commitments of $80 million to $100 million over the remainder of 2023 relating to our Japan venture\u2019s planned integrated resort in Osaka for which the amount and timing subject to change and will be dependent upon funding of the venture from noncontrolling interests and the timing and amount of financing received by the venture.\n\nWe also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our share repurchase plans. Subsequent to the quarter ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate amount of $88 million, excluding excise tax.

        "MGMRESORTS_2023Q2_10Q.pdf_page_8": "NOTE 2 \u2014 BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBasis of presentation. As permitted by the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d) have been condensed or omitted. These consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the Company\u2019s 2022 annual consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in the Company\u2019s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nIn the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements contain all adjustments, which include only normal recurring adjustments, necessary to present fairly the Company\u2019s interim financial statements. The results for such periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year.\n\nthe\n\nPrinciples of consolidation. The Company evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (\u201cVIE\u201d). The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity\u2019s equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis.\n\nThe Company has a 5% ownership interest in the venture that owns and leases back the real estate assets of Bellagio (the \u201cBellagio BREIT Venture\u201d). Bellagio BREIT Venture is a VIE of which the Company is not the primary beneficiary and, accordingly, the Company does not consolidate the venture. The Company\u2019s maximum exposure to loss in Bellagio BREIT Venture is equal to the carrying value of its investment of $55 million as of June 30, 2023, assuming no future capital funding requirements, plus the exposure to loss resulting from the Company\u2019s guarantee of the debt of Bellagio BREIT Venture, which guarantee is immaterial as of June 30, 2023, as further discussed in Note 9.\n\nFor entities determined not to be a VIE, the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company owns 100% of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity under the voting interest model if it has a controlling financial interest based upon the terms of the respective entities\u2019 ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets and all intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. If the entity does not qualify for consolidation under the voting interest model and the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the entity, the Company generally accounts for the entity under the equity method, such as BetMGM, which does not qualify for consolidation as the Company has joint control, given the entity is structured with substantive participating rights whereby both owners participate in the decision making process, which prevents the Company from exerting a controlling financial interest in such entity, as defined in Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) 810. For entities over which the Company does not have significant influence, the Company accounts for its equity investment under ASC 321.\n\nFair value measurements. Fair value measurements affect the Company\u2019s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments in unconsolidated affiliates or equity interests, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value measurements also affect the Company\u2019s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that includes: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are quoted prices for identical or comparable instruments or pricing using observable market data; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs. The Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:\n\n+ Level 1 inputs when measuring its equity investments recorded at fair value;\n\n+ Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures; See Note 6; and\n\n+ Level 1 and Level 2 inputs for its debt investments.\n\nEquity investments. Fair value is measured based upon trading prices on the applicable securities exchange for equity investments for which the Company has elected the fair value option of ASC 825 and equity investments accounted for under ASC 321 that have a readily determinable fair value. The fair value of these investments was $466 million and $461 million as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, and is reflected within \u201cOther long-term assets, net\u201d on the consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses are recorded in \u201cOther, net\u201d in the statements of operations. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded a net gain on its equity investments of $6 million and $5 million, respectively. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded a net loss on its equity investments of $23 million and $8 million, respectively.\n\nDebt investments. The Company\u2019s investments in debt securities are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair value. Gains and losses are recorded in \u201cOther, net\u201d in the statements of operations. Debt securities are considered cash equivalents if the criteria for such classification is met or otherwise classified as short-term investments within \u201cPrepaid expenses and other\u201d since the investment of cash is available for current operations.\n\nis\n\n",

Windows OEM non-Pro revenue declined, mainly due to an increased mix of opening price point devices sold, and declines in the consumer PC market. Windows Phone revenue, including related patent licensing, decreased $1.4 billion or 55%, primarily due to prior year revenue associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia that terminated when we acquired NDS.\n\nMore Personal Computing operating income decreased $938 million or 17%, primarily due to higher operating expenses, as well as a reduction in gross margin. Gross margin decreased $364 million or 2%, reflecting a reduction in Windows gross margin, offset in part by an increase in devices gross margin. Cost of revenue increased $5.1 billion or 28%, driven by higher phones cost of revenue, as well as higher Xbox Live and search infrastructure costs, offset in part by a reduction in Windows Phone cost of revenue. Phones cost of revenue increased $4.8 billion, reflecting a full year of phone sales in fiscal year 2015. Windows Phone cost of revenue decreased $897 million, driven by prior year costs associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia that terminated when we acquired NDS. Operating expenses increased $574 million or 4%, driven by a full year of NDS expenses. Research and development expenses increased $346 million or 5%, mainly due to increased investment in new product and services, including higher phone expenses, offset in part by reduced headcount-related expenses. Sales and marketing expenses increased $211 million or 3%, primarily due to higher phone expenses, offset in part by a decline in advertising and other marketing program costs.",

The excess content payments over expense is variable based on the payment terms of our content agreements and is expected to increase as we enter into more agreements with upfront cash payments, such as licensing and production of original content. In 2015, the ratio of content payments over content expense was between 1.3 and 1.4. Working capital differences include deferred revenue, taxes and semi-annual interest payments on our outstanding debt. Our receivables from members generally settle quickly and deferred revenue is a source of cash flow.**\n\n                                                              1                         2      3          4      5          6\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities       2015  2014 2013 (in thousands)    nan        nan    nan        nan\nNaN                                                        nan                       nan    nan        nan    nan        nan\n$                                                    (749,439)                         $  16483          $  97831        nan\nNet cash used in investing activities                      nan                 (179,192)    nan   (42,866)    nan  (255,968)\nNet cash provided by financing activities                  nan                   1640277    nan     541712    nan     476264\nNon-GAAP free cash flow reconciliation:                    nan                       nan    nan        nan    nan        nan\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating activities        nan                 (749,439)    nan      16483    nan      97831\nAcquisition of DVD content assets                          nan                  (77,958)    nan   (74,790)    nan   (65,927)\nPurchases of property and equipment                        nan                  (91,248)    nan   (69,726)    nan   (54,143)\nOther assets                                               nan                   (1,912)    nan       1334    nan       5939\nNon-GAAP free cash flow                                      $                 (920,557)      $  (126,699)      $   (16,300)",

An obligation for the production of content includes non-cancelable commitments under creative talent and employment agreements. An obligation for the acquisition and licensing of content is incurred at the time we enter into an agreement to obtain future titles. Once a title becomes available, a content liability is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Certain agreements include the obligation to license rights for unknown future titles, the ultimate quantity and/or fees for which are not yet determinable as of the reporting date. Traditional film output deals, or certain TV series license agreements where the number of seasons to be aired is unknown, are examples of these types of agreements. The contractual obligations table above does not include any estimated obligation for the unknown future titles, payment for which could range from less than one year to more than five years. However, these unknown obligations are expected to be significant and we believe could include approximately $3 billion to $5 billion over the next three years, with the payments for the vast majority of such amounts expected to occur after the next twelve months. The foregoing range is based on considerable management judgments and the actual amounts may differ. Once we know the title that we will receive and the license fees, we include the amount in the contractual obligations table above.\n\n(2) Long-term debt obligations include our Notes consisting of principal and interest payments. See Note 4 Long-term Debt in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further details.\n\n(3) Lease obligations include lease financing obligations of $15.6 million related to our current Los Gatos, California headquarters for which we are the deemed owner for accounting purposes, commitments of $508.3 million for our headquarters in Los Gatos, California, and our office space in Los Angeles, California and other commitments of $213.5 million and for facilities under non-cancelable operating leases. These leases have expiration dates varying through approximately 2027 .\n\n28",
        "NETFLIX_2017_10K.pdf_page_12": "We have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, which could adversely affect our financial position.\n\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations. Moreover, we expect to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future and to incur other obligations, including additional streaming content obligations. As of December 31, 2017 , we had $6.5 billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes outstanding (\u201cNotes\u201d). In addition, we have entered into a revolving credit agreement that provides for a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017 , we have not borrowed any amount under this revolving credit facility. As of December 31, 2017 , we had approximately $7.5 billion of total content liabilities as reflected on our consolidated balance sheet. Such amount does not include streaming content commitments that do not meet the criteria for liability recognition, the amounts of which are significant. For more information on our streaming content obligations, including those not on our consolidated balance sheet, see Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our substantial indebtedness and other obligations, including streaming content obligations, may:\n\n+\n\nmake it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations, including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our Notes and our other obligations;\n\n+\n\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n+ limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other general business purposes;\n\n* require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments and pay our other obligations when due;\n\n+ limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n\n+ place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors; and\n\n* increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\n\nOur streaming obligations include large multi-year commitments. As a result, we may be unable to react to any downturn in the economy or reduction in our cash flows from operations by reducing our streaming content obligations in the near-term. This could result in our needing to access the capital markets at an unfavorable time, which may negatively impact our stock price"

We have, in the past, hedged and may, in the future, hedge net investment positions in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the effects of foreign exchange fluctuations on these net investments. These hedges are accounted for as net investment hedges in accordance with U.S. GAAP. There were no outstanding net investment hedges as of May 31, 2023 and 2022. There were no cash flows from net investment hedge settlements for the years ended May 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021.\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\nCASH FLOW ACTIVITY\n\nCash provided (used) by operations was an inflow of $5,841 million for fiscal 2023, compared to $5,188 million for fiscal 2022. Net income, adjusted for non-cash items, generated $6,354 million of operating cash inflow for fiscal 2023, compared to $6,848 million for fiscal 2022. The net change in working capital and other assets and liabilities resulted in a decrease to Cash provided (used) by operations of $513 million for fiscal 2023 compared to a decrease of $1,660 million for fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2023, the net change in working capital compared to the prior year was impacted by unfavorable changes in Accounts payable, offset by favorable impacts from Inventories and Accounts receivable. These changes were, in part, due to reduced inventory purchases in the current period and timing of wholesale shipments. Further impacting these changes was a lower available supply of inventory in the prior year due to supply chain constraints.\n\nCash provided (used) by investing activities was an inflow of $564 million for fiscal 2023, compared to an outflow of $1,524 million for fiscal 2022, primarily driven by the net change in short-term investments. For fiscal 2023, the net change in short-term\n\n44 NIKE, INC.\n\ninvestments (including sales, maturities and purchases) resulted in a cash inflow of $1,481 million compared to a cash outflow of $747 million for fiscal 2022. Additionally, we continue to invest in our infrastructure to support future growth, specifically focused around digital capabilities, our end-to-end technology foundation, our corporate facilities and improvements across our supply chain.\n\nCash provided (used) by financing activities was an outflow of $7,447 million for fiscal 2023 compared to an outflow of $4,836 million for fiscal 2022. The increased outflow in fiscal 2023 was driven by higher share repurchases of $5,480 million for fiscal 2023 compared to $4,014 million for fiscal 2022, the repayment of $500 million of senior notes that matured in fiscal 2023, as well as lower proceeds from stock option exercises, which resulted in a cash inflow of $651 million in fiscal 2023 compared to $1,151 million in fiscal 2022.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, we purchased a total of 50.0 million shares of NIKE's Class B Common Stock for $5.5 billion (an average price of $110.32 per share). In August 2022, we terminated the previous four-year, $15 billion share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors in June 2018. Under this program, we repurchased 6.5 million shares for a total approximate cost of $710.0 million (an average price of $109.85 per share) during the first quarter of fiscal 2023 and 83.8 million shares for a total approximate cost of $9.4 billion (an average price of $111.82 per share) during the term of the program. Upon termination of the four-year, $15 billion program, we began purchasing shares under the new four-year, $18 billion share repurchase plan authorized by the Board of Directors in June 2022. As of May 31, 2023, we had repurchased 43.5 million shares at a cost of approximately $4.8 billion (an average price of $110.38 per share) under this new program. We continue to expect funding of share repurchases will come from operating cash flows. The timing and the amount of share repurchases will be dictated by our capital needs and stock market conditions.",

In September 2022, the Paidy Credit Agreement was modified to increase the borrowing capacity by \u00a530.0 billion for a total borrowing capacity of \u00a590.0 billion (approximately $686 million as of December 31, 2022.) Borrowings under the Paidy Credit Agreement are for use by Paidy for working capital, capital expenditures, and other permitted purposes.

The Paidy Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owed thereunder will be due and payable in February 2027, unless the commitments are terminated earlier. The Paidy Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, affirmative and negative covenants, including a financial covenant, events of default, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens and subsidiary indebtedness, in each case subject to certain exceptions.

The increase in our effective income tax rate in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily attributable to a decrease in discrete tax benefits associated with stock-based compensation deductions and an increase in tax expense related to the intra-group transfer of intellectual property.

Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets; generally, one to four years for computer equipment and software, including capitalized software and website development costs, three years for furniture and fixtures, up to 30 years for buildings and building improvements, and the shorter of five years or the non-cancelable term of the lease for leasehold improvements.\n\nDirect costs incurred to develop software for internal use and website development costs, including those costs incurred in expanding and enhancing our payments platform, are capitalized and amortized generally over an estimated useful life of three years and are recorded as amortization within the financial statement captions aligned with the internal organizations that are the primary beneficiaries of such assets. We capitalized $511 million and $462 million of internally developed software and website development costs for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amortization expense for these capitalized costs was $426 million, $366 million, and $322 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Costs related to the maintenance of internal use software and website development costs are expensed as incurred.",

In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\n\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q1 2023 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2014 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:\n\nMark-to-market net impact\n\nMark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\n\nRestructuring and impairment charges\n\nExpenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\n\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\n\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\n\nA-6\n\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction\n\nWe recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.\n\nImpairment and other charges/credits\n\nWe recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.\n\nRussia-Ukraine conflict charges\n\nIn connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.\n\nBrand portfolio impairment charges\n\nWe recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of management\u2019s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in the prior year related to the sale of a non-strategic brand.\n\nOther impairment charges\n\nWe recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflected an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our estimates of future financial performance as of the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nPension and retiree medical-related impact\n\nPension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.\n\nTax benefit related to the IRS audit\n\nWe recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.\n\nTax expense related to the TCJ Act\n\nTax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.\n\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\n\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results (53 reporting week), including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\n\n2023 guidance\n\nOur 2023 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign exchange translation and the impact of a 53\u2122 reporting week in 2022. Our 2023 core effective tax rate guidance and 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, and other items noted above. Our 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2023 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2023 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions and divestitures. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2023 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2023 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2023 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2023 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\n\nA-7"

        "PEPSICO_2023Q1_EARNINGS.pdf_page_8": "Glossary\n\nWe use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies:\n\nAcquisitions and divestitures: mergers and acquisition activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees.\n\nBottler case sales (BCS): Measure of physical beverage volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our independent bottlers.\n\nConcentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE): Measure of our physical beverage volume shipments to independent bottlers.\n\nConstant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates.\n\nCore: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our financial results. For further information regarding these excluded items, refer to \u201cItems Affecting Comparability\u201d in \u201cItem 2 - Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our Q1 2023 Form 10-Q and in \u201cItem 7 \u2014 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items:\n\nMark-to-market net impact\n\nMark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit.\n\nRestructuring and impairment charges\n\nExpenses related to the multi-year productivity plan publicly announced in 2019, which was expanded and extended through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the plan.\n\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges\n\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges include merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees.\n\nA-6\n\nGain associated with the Juice Transaction\n\nWe recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PepsiCo Beverages North America and Europe divisions.\n\nImpairment and other charges/credits\n\nWe recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below.\n\nRussia-Ukraine conflict charges\n\nIn connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs.\n\nBrand portfolio impairment charges\n\nWe recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of management\u2019s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. We also recognized adjustments to the charges recorded in the prior year related to the sale of a non-strategic brand.\n\nOther impairment charges\n\nWe recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflected an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our estimates of future financial performance as of the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nPension and retiree medical-related impact\n\nPension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains.\n\nTax benefit related to the IRS audit\n\nWe recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019.\n\nTax expense related to the TCJ Act\n\nTax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act.\n\nEffective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries.\n\nOrganic revenue growth: A measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures and every five or six years, the impact of an additional week of results (53 reporting week), including in our fourth quarter 2022 financial results. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year.\n\n2023 guidance\n\nOur 2023 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, foreign exchange translation and the impact of a 53\u2122 reporting week in 2022. Our 2023 core effective tax rate guidance and 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses, restructuring and impairment charges, and other items noted above. Our 2023 core constant currency EPS growth guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2023 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2023 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions and divestitures. We are also not able to reconcile our full year projected 2023 core effective tax rate to our full year projected 2023 reported effective tax rate and our full year projected 2023 core constant currency EPS growth to our full year projected 2023 reported EPS growth because we are unable to predict the 2023 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.\n\nA-7",

These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\n\nthe fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end R&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated while increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this program, see the Costs and Expenses\u2014Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section within MD&A.\n\nIn\n\nJuly 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing how our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by new end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining therapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\n\nIn\n\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the /tem 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nOur Business Development Initiatives\u2014We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business development activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\n\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy Portfolio\u2014In July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca ple, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent with our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can have a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of up to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)\u2014In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative medicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset programs by leveraging Flagship\u2019s ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an option to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and royalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n\n38",

AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\n\nconsumer healthcare business of GSK and Pfizer following the demerger. We continue to own 32% of the ordinary shares of Haleon after the demerger.\n\nThe carrying value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022 is $11.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, and is reported in Equity-method investments. The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $12.1 billion. Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The increase in the value of our investment from December 31, 2022 is primarily due to $271 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see Note 6) and our share of Haleon\u2019s earnings of $219 million, partially offset by $88 million in dividends received. We record our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions\u2014net. Our total share of Haleon\u2019s earnings generated in the first quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the second quarter of 2023, was $151 million. Our total share of Haleon\u2019s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the first six months of 2023, was $219 million. Our total share of the JV\u2019s earnings generated in the first quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the second quarter of 2022, was $150 million. Our total share of the JV\u2019s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the first six months of 2022, was $335 million. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences resulting from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is included in Other (income)/deductions\u2014net and was not material to our results of operations in the periods presented.

Guarantees and Indemnifications\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of July 2, 2023, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material to Pfizer.\n\nIn addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may be obligated to indemnify us. For example, in November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the transaction and as previously disclosed, each of Viatris and Pfizer has agreed to assume, and to indemnify the other for, liabilities arising out of certain matters. Also, our global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, includes certain indemnity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and Pfizer has agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain third-party claims relating to Comirnaty.\n\nSee Note 7D for information on Pfizer Inc.\u2019s guarantee of the debt issued by PIE in May 2023.\n\nWe have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer."

These charges include costs and expenses related to separation of legal entities and transaction costs.\n\nthe fourth quarter of 2022, we began taking steps through our Transforming to a More Focused Company restructuring program to optimize our end-to-end R&D operations to reduce costs and cycle times as well as to further prioritize our internal R&D portfolio in areas where our capabilities are differentiated while increasing external innovation efforts to leverage an expanding and productive biotech sector. See Note 3. For a description of savings related to this program, see the Costs and Expenses\u2014Restructuring Charges and Other Costs Associated with Acquisitions and Cost-Reduction/Productivity Initiatives section within MD&A.\n\nIn\n\nJuly 2023, we announced that in consideration of planned future investments in oncology, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, we are reorganizing how our R&D operations are conducted. Beginning in July 2023, discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for oncology will be performed by new end-to-end Oncology Research and Development platform function and discovery to early- and late-phase clinical development for all remaining therapeutic areas will be consolidated in the Pfizer Research and Development platform function.\n\nIn\n\nFor additional information about our business, strategy and operating environment, see the /tem 1. Business section and Overview of Our Performance, Operating Environment, Strategy and Outlook section within MD&A of our 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nOur Business Development Initiatives\u2014We are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. Our significant recent business development activities include the transactions discussed in Notes 1A and 2, including the proposed acquisition of Seagen, as well as the following:\n\nProposed Divestiture of Early-Stage Rare Disease Gene Therapy Portfolio\u2014In July 2023, we entered into an agreement with Alexion, a subsidiary of AstraZeneca ple, under which Alexion will purchase and license the assets of our early-stage rare disease gene therapy portfolio. This agreement is consistent with our previously announced strategy to pivot from viral capsid-based gene therapy approaches to harnessing new platform technologies that we believe can have a transformative impact on patients, such as mRNA or in vivo gene editing. Under the terms of the agreement, Alexion will pay us total consideration of up to $1 billion, plus tiered royalties based on annual net sales of the assets. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023, subject to customary closing conditions.\n\nAgreement with Flagship Pioneering, Inc. (Flagship)\u2014In July 2023, we and Flagship announced that we have partnered to create a new pipeline of innovative medicines. Under the terms of the novel agreement, we and Flagship will each invest $50 million upfront to explore opportunities to develop 10 single-asset programs by leveraging Flagship\u2019s ecosystem of more than 40 human health companies and multiple biotechnology platforms. Pfizer will fund and have an option to acquire each selected development program. Flagship and its bioplatform companies will be eligible to receive up to $700 million in milestones and royalties for each successfully commercialized program.\n\n38",

Equity-Method Investment\n\nHaleon/Consumer Healthcare JV\u2014On July 18, 2022, GSK completed a demerger of the Consumer Healthcare JV which became Haleon, an independent, publicly traded company listed on the London Stock Exchange that holds the joint historical\n\nPFIZER INC. AND SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES. NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)\n\nconsumer healthcare business of GSK and Pfizer following the demerger. We continue to own 32% of the ordinary shares of Haleon after the demerger.\n\nThe carrying value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023 and as of December 31, 2022 is $11.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively, and is reported in Equity-method investments. The fair value of our investment in Haleon as of July 2, 2023, based on quoted market prices of Haleon stock, was $12.1 billion. Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is a foreign investee whose reporting currency is the U.K. pound, and therefore we translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and recognize the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments in the carrying value of our investment and in other comprehensive income. The increase in the value of our investment from December 31, 2022 is primarily due to $271 million in pre-tax foreign currency translation adjustments (see Note 6) and our share of Haleon\u2019s earnings of $219 million, partially offset by $88 million in dividends received. We record our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV on a quarterly basis on a one-quarter lag in Other (income)/deductions\u2014net. Our total share of Haleon\u2019s earnings generated in the first quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the second quarter of 2023, was $151 million. Our total share of Haleon\u2019s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2022 and first quarter of 2023, which we recorded in our operating results in the first six months of 2023, was $219 million. Our total share of the JV\u2019s earnings generated in the first quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the second quarter of 2022, was $150 million. Our total share of the JV\u2019s earnings generated in the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022, which we recorded in our operating results in the first six months of 2022, was $335 million. The total amortization and adjustment of basis differences resulting from the excess of the initial fair value of our investment over the underlying equity in the carrying value of the net assets of Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV is included in Other (income)/deductions\u2014net and was not material to our results of operations in the periods presented.

Contingent Consideration for Acquisitions\n\nWe may be required to make payments to sellers for certain prior business combinations that are contingent upon future events or outcomes. See Note 1D in 2022 Form 10-K.\n\nNote 13. Segment, Geographic and Other Revenue Information\n\nA. Segment Information\n\nWe manage our commercial operations through two operating segments, each led by a single manager: Biopharma and Business Innovation, an operating segment established in the first quarter of 2023 that includes PC1, our contract development and manufacturing organization and a leading supplier of specialty active pharmaceutical ingredients, and Pfizer Ignite, a recently launched offering that provides strategic guidance and end-to-end R&D services to select innovative biotech companies that align with Pfizer\u2019s R&D focus areas. Biopharma is the only reportable segment. Each operating segment has responsibility for its commercial activities. Regional commercial organizations market, distribute and sell our products and are supported by global platform functions that are responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and supply of our products and global corporate enabling functions. Biopharma receives its R&D services from WRDM and GPD. These services include IPR&D projects for new investigational products and additional indications for in-line products. Each operating segment has a geographic footprint across developed and emerging markets. Our chief operating decision maker uses the revenues and earnings of the operating segments, among other factors, for performance evaluation and resource allocation.\n\nOther Business Activities and Reconciling Items\u2014Other business activities include the operating results of Business Innovation as well as certain pre-tax costs not allocated to our operating segment results, such as costs associated with: (i) R&D and medical expenses managed by our WRDM organization and costs associated with our GPD organization; (ii) corporate enabling functions and other corporate costs; (iii) overhead costs primarily associated with our manufacturing operations; and (iv) our share of earnings from Haleon/the Consumer Healthcare JV. Reconciling items include the following items, transactions and events that are not allocated to our operating segments: (i) all amortization of intangible assets; (ii) acquisition-related items; and (iii) certain significant items, representing substantive and/or unusual, and in some cases recurring, items that are evaluated on an individual basis by management and that, either as a result of their nature or size, would not be expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis.\n\n34",

We are producing records pursuant to this request.\n\nIn\n\nB. Guarantees and Indemnifications\n\nIn the ordinary course of business and in connection with the sale of assets and businesses and other transactions, we often indemnify our counterparties against certain liabilities that may arise in connection with the transaction or that are related to events and activities prior to or following a transaction. If the indemnified party were to make a successful claim pursuant to the terms of the indemnification, we may be required to reimburse the loss. These indemnifications are generally subject to various restrictions and limitations. Historically, we have not paid significant amounts under these provisions and, as of July 2, 2023, the estimated fair value of these indemnification obligations is not material to Pfizer.\n\nIn addition, in connection with our entry into certain agreements and other transactions, our counterparties may be obligated to indemnify us. For example, in November 2020, we and Mylan completed the transaction to spin-off our Upjohn Business and combine it with Mylan to form Viatris. As part of the transaction and as previously disclosed, each of Viatris and Pfizer has agreed to assume, and to indemnify the other for, liabilities arising out of certain matters. Also, our global agreement with BioNTech to co-develop a mRNA-based coronavirus vaccine program aimed at preventing COVID-19 infection, includes certain indemnity provisions pursuant to which each of BioNTech and Pfizer has agreed to indemnify the other for certain liabilities that may arise in connection with certain third-party claims relating to Comirnaty.\n\nSee Note 7D for information on Pfizer Inc.\u2019s guarantee of the debt issued by PIE in May 2023.\n\nWe have also guaranteed the long-term debt of certain companies that we acquired and that now are subsidiaries of Pfizer."

Co-designed by Ulta Beauty and Target, the Ulta Beauty at Target shop is intended to reflect the Ulta Beauty experience with a unique and elevated presentation in 1,000 square feet of dedicated space separate but adjacent to Target\u2019s core beauty department. The shop is staffed by Target team members who are trained by Ulta Beauty to provide recommendations and answer product questions. Members in our loyalty program, Ultamate Rewards, can earn points (but not redeem) for purchases made in the Ulta Beauty at Target shop. Loyalty points can only be redeemed in Ulta Beauty stores, on Ulta.com or through our mobile applications. As of January 28, 2023, Ulta Beauty at Target was available in over 350 Target locations and on target.com. Over time, we expect Ulta Beauty at Target to be in up to 800 Target locations, in addition to our freestanding Ulta Beauty stores.\n\nMerchandising\n\nStrategy\n\nWe offer one of the most extensive product and brand selections in our industry, including a broad assortment of branded and private label beauty products in cosmetics, fragrance, haircare, skincare, bath and body products, and salon styling tools. Across our stores, Ulta.com and our mobile applications, we offer more than 25,000 products from more than 600 well-established and emerging beauty brands across all categories and price points, including Ulta Beauty\u2019s own private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection. Our merchandising team continually monitors beauty and fashion trends, historical sales trends, and new product launches to keep Ulta Beauty\u2019s product assortment fresh and relevant and to ensure that our assortment reflects the diversity of our guests. We believe our broad selection of merchandise, from moderately-priced brands to higher-end prestige brands, creates a unique shopping experience for our guests.\n\nCertain beauty enthusiasts are growing more interested in choosing products that support their own personal well-being and the well-being of workers, animals, communities, and the environment, and they are increasingly supporting brands whose products and actions align with their own values. Reflecting the growing importance of these trends, in fiscal 2020 we launched Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty\u00ae in all stores, on Ulta.com, and on our mobile applications. This holistic initiative provides transparency for guests to help them choose brands and products that reflect their personal values and individual needs. Through this initiative, we certify brands and products across four key pillars, Clean Ingredients, Cruelty Free, Vegan, and Sustainable Packaging, and recognize brands for their positive impact on our\n\nTable of Contents\n\ncommunity. Displayed in stores on an endcap constructed of recycled and recyclable materials, the program launched with 187 brands. As of January 28, 2023, more than 300 brands participated in the program, with more than half certified in more than one pillar. As part of the launch, we published our \u201cMade Without List,\u201d an evolving ingredient standard for clean beauty products, and established the Conscious Beauty Advisory Council, a coalition of experts at the forefront of clean beauty, product development, and packaging sustainability. With the help of our Advisory Council, we will ensure that Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty\u00ae will continue to evolve and grow as expectations and standards for clean beauty continue to change.\n\nDuring the past few years consumers have increased their focus on self-care. Based on internal proprietary research, approximately 65% of consumers see the beauty category as being significantly connected to wellness. In response to this trend, we launched The Wellness Shop in select stores and online that offers an assortment of products across six platforms: everyday care, supplements and ingestibles, relax and renew, down there care, spa at home, and intimate wellness (online only).\n\nWe have a long tradition of being a diversity-forward company. We aspire to be beauty at its most inclusive and have made several important commitments across our marketing, assortment, and training efforts to ensure guests, associates, partners, and communities feel connected to and reflected at Ulta Beauty and are able to discover beauty on their own terms. During fiscal 2022, we increased our assortment of Black-owned and Black-founded brands by 34% with the addition of 12 Black-owned and Black-founded brands, supporting our progress towards our commitment to dedicate 15% of our brand assortment to Black-owned, Black-founded and Black-led brands over time.\n\nWe believe our private label, the Ulta Beauty Collection, is a strategically important opportunity for growth and profit contribution. Our objective is to provide quality, trend-right private label products to continue to strengthen our guests\u2019 perception of Ulta Beauty as a contemporary beauty destination. Ulta Beauty manages the full development cycle of these products from concept through production to deliver differentiated packaging and formulas that enhance our brand image. The Ulta Beauty Collection has been certified in the Clean Ingredients and Cruelty Free pillars within the Conscious Beauty at Ulta Beauty\u00ae program. We also offer products such as Tarte Double Duty Beauty cosmetics, IT Brushes for Ulta Beauty, and CHI for Ulta Beauty hair care appliances that are permanently exclusive to Ulta Beauty. Similarly, we offer a number of brands and products that are exclusive for a limited period of time or are offered in advance of our competitors, such as Morphe, Colourpop, Juvia\u2019s Place, Chanel and Florence. The Ulta Beauty Collection and permanent Ulta Beauty exclusive products represented approximately 4% of our total net sales in fiscal 2022. Both permanent and temporary exclusive products represented approximately 10% of our total net sales in fiscal 2022.",

These milestone achievements demonstrate the power of Ulta Beauty\u2019s highly differentiated model, the health of the growing beauty category, and our winning culture and outstanding teams.\u201d\n\nKimbell continued, \u201cAs we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category, and | am excited about the opportunities ahead to continue to expand our leadership position, capture market share gains, and drive long term value for all our stakeholders.\u201d\n\nFor the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2022\n\n\u00a2 Net sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, and the impact of new brands and product innovation compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nComparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 21.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by a 13.6% increase in transactions and a 1.8% increase in average ticket.\n\nGross profit increased 18.0% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit of 37.6% was flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts, and strong growth in other revenue, offset by higher inventory shrink.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.3% to $762.7 million compared to $650.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.6% compared to 23.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments and deleverage in corporate overhead due to strategic investments.\n\nOperating income increased 19.2% to $447.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales, compared to $375.6 million, or 13.8% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nThe tax rate increased to 24.6% compared to 22.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nNet income increased 17.8% to $340.8 million compared to $289.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nDiluted earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68, including a $0.02 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $5.41 including a $0.05 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.",

These milestone achievements demonstrate the power of Ulta Beauty\u2019s highly differentiated model, the health of the growing beauty category, and our winning culture and outstanding teams.\u201d\n\nKimbell continued, \u201cAs we move into fiscal 2023, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category, and | am excited about the opportunities ahead to continue to expand our leadership position, capture market share gains, and drive long term value for all our stakeholders.\u201d\n\nFor the Fourth Quarter of Fiscal 2022\n\n\u00a2 Net sales increased 18.2% to $3.2 billion compared to $2.7 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 primarily due to the favorable impact from the continued resilience of the beauty category, retail price increases, and the impact of new brands and product innovation compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nComparable sales (sales for stores open at least 14 months and e-commerce sales) increased 15.6% compared to an increase of 21.4% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, driven by a 13.6% increase in transactions and a 1.8% increase in average ticket.\n\nGross profit increased 18.0% to $1.2 billion compared to $1.0 billion in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit of 37.6% was flat compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of fixed costs, favorable channel mix shifts, and strong growth in other revenue, offset by higher inventory shrink.\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased 17.3% to $762.7 million compared to $650.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 23.6% compared to 23.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, primarily due to leverage of marketing expenses and incentive compensation due to higher sales, partially offset by deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments and deleverage in corporate overhead due to strategic investments.\n\nOperating income increased 19.2% to $447.6 million, or 13.9% of net sales, compared to $375.6 million, or 13.8% of net sales, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nThe tax rate increased to 24.6% compared to 22.9% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nNet income increased 17.8% to $340.8 million compared to $289.4 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.\n\nDiluted earnings per share increased 23.5% to $6.68, including a $0.02 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, compared to $5.41 including a $0.05 benefit due to income tax accounting for stock-based compensation, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021.",

A portion of the gains recognized in Other comprehensive income (loss) was reclassified to Other income (expense), net to offset the related pre-tax foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the underlying hedged item. See Note 14 for additional information.\n\nForward Starting Interest Rate Swaps\n\nWe have entered into forward starting interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges in order to manage our exposure to interest rate changes on future forecasted transactions. We hedge our exposure to the variability in future cash flows based on the expected maturities of the related forecasted debt issuance. We recognize gains and losses resulting from interest rate movements in Other comprehensive income (loss).\n\nVerizon 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n86\n\nTreasury Rate Locks\n\nWe enter into treasury rate locks to mitigate our interest rate risk.

In March 2021, we de-designated the existing net investment hedge and designated a new net investment hedge using a different Euro-denominated note. The notional amount of Euro-denominated debt designated as a net investment hedge was \u20ac750 million as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020.",

The translation of income statement and balance sheet amounts of our foreign operations into U.S. dollars is recorded as cumulative translation adjustments, which are included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses on foreign currency transactions are recorded in the consolidated statements of income in Other income (expense), net. At December 31, 2021, our primary translation exposure was to the British Pound Sterling, Euro, Australian Dollar, and Japanese Yen.\n\nCross Currency Swaps\n\nWe have entered into cross currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges to exchange our British Pound Sterling, Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar and Australian Dollar-denominated cash flows into U.S. dollars and to fix our cash payments in U.S. dollars, as well as to mitigate the impact of foreign currency transaction gains or losses.

The CSA agreements contain rating based thresholds such that we or our counterparties may be required to hold or post collateral based upon changes in outstanding positions as compared to established thresholds and changes in credit ratings. We do not offset fair value amounts recognized for derivative instruments and fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or the obligation to return cash collateral arising from derivative instruments recognized at fair value.

Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2.4 billion during 2022 compared to 2021, primarily driven by higher device payment receivables as our device payment portfolio increased over the comparative period, which was partially due to the change in device payment plan terms to 36 months. This decrease was further driven by a decrease in earnings. We expect to make approximately $200 million of discretionary pension contributions in 2023. Additionally, we expect that there will be no required pension funding through 2026, subject to changes in market conditions.\n\nCash Flows Used In Investing Activities\n\nCapital Expenditures\n\nCapital expenditures continue to relate primarily to the use of capital resources to increase the operating efficiency and productivity of our networks, maintain our existing infrastructure, facilitate the introduction of new products and services and enhance responsiveness to competitive challenges.\n\nCapital expenditures, including capitalized software, were $23.1 billion and $20.3 billion for 2022 and 2021, respectively. Capital expenditures increased approximately $2.8 billion during 2022, compared to 2021, primarily due to accelerating our 5G technology deployment. See \"Global Network and Technology\" for more details.\n\nAcquisitions of Wireless Licenses\n\nIn February 2021, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) completed an auction, Auction 107, for mid-band spectrum known as C-Band. During 2021, we paid approximately $45.9 billion for spectrum licenses in connection with this auction and related costs, of which $1.3 billion was primarily paid for certain obligations related to projected clearing costs. During 2022, we made additional payments of $1.6 billion for obligations related to accelerated clearing incentives and clearing costs associated with the auction.\n\nIn March 2022, Verizon signed agreements with satellite operators in which operators agreed to clear C-Band spectrum in certain markets and frequencies ahead of the previously expected December 2023 timeframe. During 2022, Verizon made payments of approximately $310 million associated with these agreements.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we recorded capitalized interest related to wireless licenses of $1.7 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively.\n\nDuring 2022 and 2021, we entered into and completed various other wireless license acquisitions for cash consideration of an insignificant amount and $95 million, respectively.",

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (the Company) is a holding company that, acting through its subsidiaries (together with the Company, collectively, Verizon), is one of the world\u2019s leading providers of communications, technology, information and entertainment products and services to consumers, businesses and government entities. With a presence around the world, we offer data, video and voice services and solutions on our networks and platforms that are designed to meet customers\u2019 demand for mobility, reliable network connectivity, security and control.\n\nTo compete effectively in today\u2019s dynamic marketplace, we are focused on the capabilities of our high-performing networks to drive growth based on delivering what customers want and need in the digital world. In 2022, we focused on maintaining our network leadership, including by rapidly deploying C-Band spectrum; retaining and growing our high-quality customer base while balancing profitability in challenging market conditions; and driving monetization of our networks, platforms and solutions. We are creating business value by earning the trust of our stakeholders, limiting our environmental impact and supporting our customer base growth while creating social benefit through our products and services. Our strategy requires significant capital investments primarily to acquire wireless spectrum, put the spectrum into service, provide additional capacity for growth in our networks, invest in the fiber that supports our businesses, evolve and maintain our networks and develop and maintain significant advanced information technology systems and data system capabilities. 2022 was a peak year of capital investment for us as we rapidly deployed C-Band spectrum. We believe that this spectrum, together with our industry leading millimeter wave spectrum holding, 4G LTE network and fiber infrastructure, will drive innovative products and services and fuel our growth.\n\nWe are consistently deploying new network architecture and technologies to secure our leadership in both fourth-generation (4G) and fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks. We expect that our next-generation multi-use platform, which we call the Intelligent Edge Network, will simplify operations by eliminating legacy network elements, speed the deployment of 5G wireless technology and create new opportunities in the business market in a cost efficient manner. Our network leadership is the hallmark of our brand and the foundation for the connectivity, platforms and solutions upon which we build our competitive advantage."
