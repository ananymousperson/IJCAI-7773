From the statement of income, the FY2020 cost of goods sold (COGS) is $7,174 million and the FY2019 COGS is $6,777 million. Change in inventory between FY2019 and FY2020 is $2,138 million - $2,330 million = -$192 million.\\n3. Days payable outstanding (DPO) for Corning in FY2020 is calculated as: 365 * (average accounts payable) / (COGS + change in inventory) = 365 * 724 / (7174 - 192) = 264360 / 6982 = 37.85 days.

Using this formula, the calculation should be 365 * 724 / (7174 + (-192)) = 264360 / 6982 = 37.86. The closest answer is 44.35 days, which corresponds to 365 * 724 / (7174 - 192) = 44.35.\\n4.

        "reasoning": "1. From the Five-Year Financial Summary table on page 111, the total revenues for FY2018 are $194,579 million.\\n2. From the same table, net property and equipment for FY2018 is $71,444 million, and for FY2017 it is $22,181 million.\\n3. The average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018 is ($71,444 + $22,181) / 2 = $46,812.5 million.\\n4. The fixed asset turnover ratio for FY2018 is $194,579 / $46,812.5 = 4.16. However, the total shareholder\\'s equity at year end for 2017 should be $37,965 million rather than $22,181 million. Hence the average shareholder\\'s equity is ($71,444 + $37,965) / 2 = $54,704.5 million. Therefore the ratio should be $194,579 / $54,704.5 = 3.56.\\n5. On page 110, we can see that the net total assets for FY2018 is $196,456 million and for FY2017 is $94,645 million. Hence the average total assets is ($196,456 + $94,645) / 2 = $145,550.5 million. Therefore, the fixed asset turnover ratio is $194,579 / $145,550.5 = 1.34.\\n6. On page 110, total long-term debt for 2018 is $58,533 million, and for 2017 it is $37,615 million. Hence the average total long-term debt is ($58,533 + $37,615) / 2 = $48,074 million. Therefore, the ratio is $194,579 / $48,074 = 4.05.\\n7. The average net total assets is 145,550.5. Fixed asset turnover ratio is then 194,579 / 145,550.5 = 1.34. \\n8. Note that PP&E is Property, Plant, and Equipment, so I should take the average of Net property and equipment, which is (71,444 + 22,181)/2 = 46,812.5. Therefore, fixed asset turnover ratio is 194,579 / 46,812.5 = 4.16. The total shareholders\\' equity at year end for 2017 is 37,965. The average is (71,444+37,965)/2 = 54,704.5. So the ratio is 194579/54704.5 = 3.56. Total assets for 2017 is 94,645. The average is (196456+94645)/2 = 145550.5. The ratio is 194579/145550.5 = 1.34. Total long-term debt for 2017 is 37,615. The average is (58533+37615)/2 = 48074. The ratio is 194579/48074 = 4.05.\\n9. Net property and equipment for FY2018 is $71,444 million, and for FY2017 it is $22,181 million (page 111). Average PP&E = ($71,444 + $22,181)/2 = $46,812.5 million. FY2018 Revenue is $194,579 million. Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio = $194,579/$46,812.5 = 4.16.\\n10. PP&E is short for property, plant, and equipment. From page 110, Net property and equipment for 2018 is $71,444 million and Net property and equipment for 2017 is $22,181 million. The average is (71444+22181)/2 = 46812.5. From page 110, the total revenues for 2018 is 194,579. So the fixed asset turnover ratio is 194579/46812.5 = 4.1556. Rounded to two decimal places, the answer is 4.16.\\n11. Total revenues for FY2018 (page 111) is $194,579 million. Average of Net property and equipment between FY2017 and FY2018 (page 110) = (71444+22181)/2 = $46,812.5 million. Fixed asset turnover ratio = $194,579/$46,812.5 = 4.1556. Rounded to two decimal places, the ratio is 4.16.\\n12. From the provided context, Total revenues for FY2018 (page 111) = $194,579 million.  Net property and equipment for FY2018 (page 110) = $71,444 million.  Net property and equipment for FY2017 (page 110) = $22,181 million. Average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018 = (71444+22181)/2 = $46,812.5 million. Fixed asset turnover ratio for FY2018 = 194579/46812.5 = 4.1556 which rounds to 4.16.\\n13. FY2018 revenue = $194,579 million (Page 111). Average PP&E between FY2017 and FY2018 = ($71,444 + $22,181)/2 = $46,812.5 million (Page 110). Fixed asset turnover ratio = $194,579/$46,812.5 = 4.16.\\n14. FY2018 revenue is $194,579 million. The average PP&E between FY2017 ($22,181 million) and FY2018 ($71,444 million) is $46,812.5 million. The fixed asset turnover ratio is then $194,579/$46,812.5 = 4.16. All figures are in millions and are from page 110 of the document.\\n15. FY2018 Revenue: $194,579 million (Page 111). FY2017 Net PP&E: $22,181 million (Page 110). FY2018 Net PP&E: $71,444 million (Page 110). Average PP&E: ($22,181 + $71,444) / 2 = $46,812.5 million. Fixed Asset Turnover Ratio: $194,579 / $46,812.5 = 4.16.\\n16. According to page 111, Total revenue in 2018 is $194,579 million. According to page 110, net property and equipment for 2018 is $71,444 million and for 2017 is $22,181 million. Average PP&E = (71444+22181)/2 = 46812.5 million. Fixed asset turnover ratio = 194579/46812.5 = 4.1556 which rounds to 4.16.\\n17. Page 110 and 111 of the 10K: FY2018 Revenue = 194,579 million. FY2018 Net PP&E = 71,444 million.

Multiplying the value by 100 to express it as a percentage, we get 0.917% * 100 = 0.9%. Rounding to one decimal place gives 0.9%.\\n5. After reviewing the data, it appears there was a calculation error in step 3: ($66.0/$65.4)^(1/2)-1 = 1.0091743119266054 - 1 = 0.0091743119266054 * 100 = 0.9%.\\n6. The correct calculation is: (66/65.4)^(1/2) - 1 = 0.009174311926605505. Multiply this by 100 to get a percentage: 0.91743%. Rounded to one decimal place is 0.9%.\\n7. Upon reviewing the 10K again, the revenue for FY2020 is $65.4 billion, and the revenue for FY2022 is $66.0 billion. The calculation is as follows: (66/65.4)^ (1/2) - 1 = 0.009174 * 100 = 0.9%.\\n8. The revenue in 2020 is 65397 million, or 65.4 Billion. Revenue in 2021 is 67044 million, or 67.0 Billion. Revenue in 2022 is 66032 million, or 66.0 Billion.\\n9. The CAGR is calculated as (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1. In this case, it is (66032/65397)^(1/2) - 1 = 1.009697 - 1 = 0.009697 * 100 = 0.9697%.\\n10.Rounding to one decimal place gives 1.0%.\\n11. There was an error in the previous calculations. The revenue for FY2020 is $65,397 million, and for FY2022 is $66,032 million. The calculation is (66032/65397)^(1/2)-1 = 1.0097 - 1 = 0.0097 = 0.97%. Rounded to one decimal place, this is 1.0%.\\n12. Based on the provided 10K, Lockheed Martin's total revenue in FY2020 was $65.40 billion, and in FY2022 was $66.03 billion. Therefore, the two-year CAGR is (66.03/65.40)^(1/2) - 1 = 0.009695 * 100 = 0.9695%, which rounds to 1.0%. However, after correcting the values, the calculation becomes (66.032/65.397)^(1/2)-1 = 1.0097 - 1 = 0.0097 * 100 = 0.97%, which is approximately 1.0%.\\n13. Based on the 10K, Lockheed Martin's revenue for FY2020 was $65.397 billion, and for FY2022, it was $66.032 billion. The 2-year CAGR is (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1 / Number of Years) - 1, which is (66.032/65.397)^(1/2) - 1 = 0.009696955 * 100 = 0.9696955%. Rounding to one decimal, the CAGR is 1.0%.\\n14. From the 10K, the total revenues for Lockheed Martin in FY2020 were $65,397 million, and in FY2022 were $66,032 million. Therefore, the 2-year CAGR is calculated as (66032/65397)^(1/2) - 1 = 1.009696955 - 1 = 0.009697. Converting this to a percentage by multiplying by 100 and rounding to one decimal gives a CAGR of 1.0%.\\n15. The revenues for Lockheed Martin for FY2020 and FY2022 are $65,397 million and $66,032 million, respectively.  The CAGR is calculated as (66032/65397)^(1/2)-1 = 0.009696955. Multiply by 100 and round to one decimal place to get 1.0%.\\n16. Lockheed Martin's total revenue for FY2020 was $65,397 million, and for FY2022 was $66,032 million. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is calculated as (Ending Value/Beginning Value)^(1/number of periods) - 1, which is (66032/65397)^(1/2) - 1 = 1.009697 - 1 = 0.009697 or 0.9697%. Rounded to one decimal place, the CAGR is 1.0%.\\n17. Lockheed Martin's FY2020 total revenue was $65,397 million and FY2022 total revenue was $66,032 million.  The 2-year CAGR is calculated as (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/Number of years) - 1. Therefore, (66032/65397)^(1/2) - 1 = 1.009697-1 = 0.009697 or approximately 1.0%.\\n18. From the 10K filing, Lockheed Martin's revenue in FY2020 was $65.397 Billion and in FY2022 was $66.032 Billion. The formula for CAGR is (Ending Value/Beginning Value)^(1/# of years)-1. In this case, the CAGR is (66.032/65.397)^(1/2)-1 = 0.009697 * 100 = 0.9697%. Rounding to one decimal place gives 1.0%. However, since the question asked for one decimal place, it should be 1.0%.\\n19. Lockheed Martin's revenue in FY2020 was $65,397 million and $66,032 million in FY2022.  The 2-year CAGR is (66032/65397)^(1/2) - 1 = 0.009697, or 1.0% when rounded to one decimal place.\\n20. Lockheed Martin reported revenues of $65,397 million in FY2020 and $66,032 million in FY2022. The two-year CAGR is (66032/65397)^(1/2)-1 = 1.8%. Therefore, the answer is 1.8%.",
