The cyclical nature is further evidenced by:\n   - Boeing's vulnerability to economic fluctuations as shown in their fixed-price contracts\n   - The company's exposure to international market cycles with 41% of revenues from non-U.S. sales\n   - Historical industry performance showing major swings (e.g., $138B losses in 2020, $42B in 2021)\n\n3. The context confirms cyclicality affects multiple business segments:\n   - Commercial Airplanes (BCA) segment is particularly susceptible to airline industry cycles\n   - Defense segment faces cyclical government budget priorities\n   - Global Services follows commercial and defense customer cycles\n\n4.
