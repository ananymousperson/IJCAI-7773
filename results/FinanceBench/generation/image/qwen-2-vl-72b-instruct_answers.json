The percentage change and client involvement suggest strong financials.\n- Corporate & Investment Bank (CIB): Exhibits robust performance with high rankings in investment banking fees and increased markets revenue. This level of activity strongly indicates high net income.\n- Commercial Bank (CB): Reflects positive but less dramatic growth compared to CCB and CIB. Gross investment banking revenue and average loans provide a solid performance indicator.\n- Asset & Wealth Management (AWM): Demonstrates a balanced performance with managed assets at $2.7 trillion. The stability in loans and deposits, however, does not suggest an outsized net income figure.\n\nGiven these points (specifically looking at active users, deposits, and overall asset figures), we can reasonably deduce that CCB had the highest net income due to the substantial increase in average deposits and client engagement metrics, which are key indicators of net income for retail banking operations.
