The depreciation figure may be found under either 'depreciation, amortization, and asset (gains)/losses, net' or 'asset impairment.' Finally, we add back 'depreciation and amortization' to arrive at the unadjusted EBITDA.\n3. Consulting American Water Works's income statement for FY 2021 reveals 'operating revenues' amounting to 4,471 million USD, accompanied by 'operating expenses' of 2,891 million USD, resulting in an operating income of 1,580 million USD.\n4. Additionally, American Water Works's cash flow statement for FY 2021 indicates 'depreciation and amortization' of 789 million USD.

To compare US sales growth with international sales growth, we can calculate the difference in growth rates for both Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical between the two regions. For Consumer Health, the difference is 10.9% (US) - 5.8% (International) = 5.1 percentage points. For Pharmaceutical, the difference is 14.9% (International) - 0.6% (US) = 14.3 percentage points. 3. Based on these calculations, it appears that US sales growth was higher for Consumer Health but lower for Pharmaceutical compared to international sales growth in FY2022. 4.

        "reasoning": "1. From the PDF, we can see that PepsiCo raised full year guidance in respect of core constant currency EPS growth by 1.5% in FY2023Q1. 2. We can compare the guidance from Q1 to the guidance in Q4 to see how much it has changed. 3. The guidance in Q4 was 6% and the guidance in Q1 is 7.5%, so the EPS guidance has increased by 1.5%. 4. Therefore, the answer is 1.5%.",

The relevant financial data is the Purchase Price Percentage of Net Earnings (PPNE), which was 4.687% in FY21 and 5.292% in FY20. 2. Employing financial reasoning or calculations. Since 4.687% is less than 5.292%, Pfizer decreased its PPNE between FY20 and FY21. 3. Verifying context details. The FY20 and FY21 PPNE percentages are correct according to the context. 4.

According to the document, Pfizer incurred US$ 503.0 million in pretax gains related to the sale of its CMC Park Ring of Fire site located in Ireland in the first nine months of 2019.\n3. This gain is considered a non-operating item and is not part of Pfizer's core business operations.\n4.

            "3 - The report specifies that the Upjohn Business was spun off on November 16, 2020, but it does not provide information on how this value changed after the date of valuation.",
            "4 - Since Pfizer continues to experience a value of $12.7 billion on November 16, 2020, this value, rather than the lower value immediately beforehand, should be considered accurate for the reporting period's length and therefore for one day.",
            "5 - Using this value as the total, we cannot know how payments were discounted over three months, nor if they were based on rate payments or not.",
            "However, it seems likely that the value given during the quarter represents the goods' value at the start, and it has since been discounted until the day it was finally spun off on November 16, 2020.",
            "6 - If we are to ignore these nuances and focus on the valuation instead, $12.7 billion/91 days for quarterly consideration = $139 million per day for quarterly consideration.",
            "However, the value from consideration is only for 3 months, and this payment is monthly, so if we take $139 million * 3 months from March, we get approximately $417 million for three months, and, dividing this by 91 days, we arrive at a value of approximately $4.58 million day, and, divided by this amount by 3 months * 3 days in each month, we arrive at a value of approximately $1.5313 million for each day, and, after 12 days in a month, $18.37. This is the amount we would expect to receive in the future if we can job value daily payments this way."

        "reasoning": "1. We start by locating the \"SELECTED FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)\" section on page 9 (PDF page 11) for Pfizer's revenues, broken down by geographic region and therapeutic areas.\n2. However, these tables lack year-over-year percentages and instead offer \"reported\" and \"operational\" growth rates. Although they offer a comprehensive view of Pfizer's revenue performance, they cannot directly answer the question about the biggest drop in Q2 2023 revenues on a year-over-year operational basis.\n3. We then proceed to the \"Revenues\u2014Selected Product Discussion\" section on page 11 (PDF page 13) and the subsequent pages, which consist of a single-page table divided across multiple PDF pages. This table spans from page 11 (PDF page 13) to page 19 (PDF page 21). The table lists Pfizer's products, their operational revenues in U.S. dollars for Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, as well as the corresponding operational growth rates of those revenues.\n4. However, this information still falls short in determining the individual year-over-year revenue percentage change for each geographic area.\n5. Finally, we direct our attention to the \"Table 6: Revenue Summary\" featured on page 20 (PDF page 22). This table presents total revenues in millions of U.S. dollars for Q2 2022 and Q2 2023, with the respective year-over-year operational growth rates.\n6. Based on Pfizer's operational year-over-year revenue increase of 9%, we cross-reference the year-over-year revenue growth table of geographic operational revenue growth and confirm the U.S. exhibited an increase of 10%, exceeding overall revenue growth. Consequently, we also note that Worldwide Revenues, International Revenues, and Total Revenues did not grow at a slower percentage rate compared to overall operational revenue growth, thereby categorically ruling out these areas as the answer options.\n7. The only two viable geographic regions for the answer are \"U.S.\" and \"International,\" as the question pertains to either of the two geographical regions. After ruling out the U.S., the operational growth rate on the Worldwide operational growth table for International is 8% - precisely 1% below total operational growth of 9%, making International the only choice.",

For Verizon in FY 2022, the current assets excluding inventory were $143,466, and the current liabilities were $83,955, resulting in a quick ratio of 1.70. A quick ratio above 1.0 generally indicates a good liquidity position, meaning Verizon can cover its short-term liabilities. However, while a high quick ratio suggests strong liquidity, it could also imply inefficient use of assets if too much cash is held instead of being invested in higher-return assets.",
        "answer": "Verizon has a reasonable liquidity profile for FY 2022 with a quick ratio of 1.70, indicating sufficient liquid assets to cover short-term obligations. However, this should not be the sole measure for assessing liquidity."

        "reasoning": "To determine if Verizon is a capital-intensive business based on FY 2022 data, we need to analyze its financial metrics. The provided PDF pages do not contain specific financial metrics for Verizon in FY 2022. However, we can use general guidelines to evaluate capital intensity. Typically, a capital-intensive business has high levels of Property, Plant, and Equipment (PP&E) and/or significant capital expenditures relative to its revenue. Without explicit data on PP&E or capital expenditures for Verizon in FY 2022, we cannot directly calculate its capital intensity. However, we know that telecommunications companies like Verizon often require substantial investments in infrastructure such as cell towers, network equipment, and technology upgrades. Despite the lack of specific numbers for FY 2022, it's common knowledge that Verizon, like other major telecom providers, invests heavily in maintaining and expanding its network capabilities. This investment pattern suggests a high dependency on capital assets. Given the nature of the telecommunications industry and the absence of contradictory information, it is reasonable to infer that Verizon would be considered a capital-intensive business based on its typical operational requirements and the industry's standard practices.",
