The total restructuring liability decreased from:\n   - $118 million at June 30, 2022\n   - To $93 million at December 31, 2022\n   - Due to $25 million in cash payments and $2 million in unused amount reversals\n\n4. The company expects the majority of these liabilities to be paid within the next twelve months, suggesting this is primarily a short-term restructuring obligation.",

The context explicitly states two main factors that drove the reduction:\n   - Leverage of marketing expenses\n   - Leverage of incentive compensation due to higher sales\n\n3. These improvements were partially offset by:\n   - Deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments\n   - Deleverage in corporate overhead due to strategic investments\n\n4. The overall effect resulted in a 0.2 percentage point reduction in SG&A as a percent of sales (from 23.8% to 23.6%)",

From the balance sheet data, merchandise inventories increased from $1.5 billion at the end of FY2021 to $1.6 billion at the end of FY2022, representing a $104.2 million increase.\n\n2. According to the provided context, this increase was primarily driven by three main factors:\n   - Opening of 47 new stores since January 29, 2022\n   - Inventory to support new brand launches and brand expansions\n   - Inventory cost increases\n\n3. Verification from store data:\n   - The company did open 47 new stores during fiscal 2022\n   - Total store count increased from 1,308 to 1,355 stores\n   - This expansion required additional inventory to stock new locations\n\n4. The increase appears to be a planned growth initiative rather than an unexpected inventory buildup, as it aligns with the company's expansion strategy and product innovation efforts.",

        "reasoning": "1. Looking at the SG&A expenses section in the fourth quarter report, there is specific mention of \"deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments\"\n\n2. This suggests that wages as a percentage of sales increased, since \"deleverage\" means that costs grew at a faster rate than sales\n\n3. The specific text states there was \"deleverage of store payroll and benefits due to wage investments\", indicating the company made deliberate investments in higher wages that outpaced sales growth\n\n4. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that this wage deleverage partially offset other positive factors in SG&A expenses like marketing leverage and incentive compensation\n\n5. The financial statements show overall SG&A expenses decreased slightly as a percentage of sales (from 23.8% to 23.6% in Q4), but this was despite the wage pressure, not because of it",

Looking at the Estimated Future Benefit Payments table in the provided context, I can see two different payments scheduled for 2024:\n- Pension Benefits: $1,097 million\n- Health Care and Life: $862 million\n\n2. Since the question asks about total payments to retirees, I need to add both types of benefits:\n$1,097 million + $862 million = $1,959 million\n\n3. This total represents the complete expected benefit payments to retirees for the year 2024, as projected in FY 2021.\n\n4.
