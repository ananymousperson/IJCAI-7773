From the cash flow statement on page 48 of the 2018 10-K filing, we can infer that the capital expenditures for 2018 were in the Investments category, which is indicated as 'Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities.' 2. We can then find a relevant detail in the note mentioning 'capital projects related to protecting the environment,' one specific capital expenditure of '$27 million' for 2018. 3. As no further explicit capital expenditure amount for 2018 in the millions is given in the available pages, we can assume that the $27 million may be part of or the entire amount of the capital expenditure that had a direct impact on the investment activities. 4.

Beth indicated that total assets were $24,280 million as of December 31, 2017.\n2. Similarly, Beth provided data for Non-current assets. According to her, Non-current assets were $11,394 million as of December 31, 2017, and $22,705 million as of December 31, 2018. This implies that Plant, Property, and Equipment (PPNE) are part of the non-current assets\n3. Per the user's information, early 2017, 3M had net PPNE of roughly $10 billion. This is lower than the net PPNE reported in the year-end FY2018 on the balance sheet.4. Seeing a difference in net PPNE over the period and given that both non-current assets and total assets have increased, it\u2019s appropriate to consider the net PPNE has also increased.\n",

This ratio gives an indication of a company's reliance on new capital investments to maintain or expand its operations. The context provides 3M's net cash spent on property, plant, and equipment for FY2022, which we can use to calculate CapEx. There is no information provided directly about total assets or net sales for FY2022, but historically, if the CapEx as a percentage of total assets is high, it can indicate a capital-intensive business model. \n2 - From page 40 of the 10K, we find 3M spent $1,749 million in FY2022 on property, plant, and equipment, indicating a significant investment in assets. \n3 - Without total assets data, it is difficult to calculate the precise CapEx percentage, but the large outlay indicates that CapEx is notable. \n4 - Given the significance of the expenditure and the nature of 3M's diversified operations, it is reasonable to deduce that 3M is likely capital intensive.",

The narrative explicitly states that 'sales increased in automotive and aerospace, commercial solutions, and advanced materials, and decreased in transportation safety and electronics.' However, it also mentions that growth was held back by weaker consumer electronics end-market demand and ongoing impacts of semiconductor supply chain constraints on automotive markets. Additionally, it highlights that divestiture impacts reduced sales. Lastly, it notes that special item charges further impacted margins. 4. Conclusion: Given that the only segment mentioned as having a decrease in sales on an organic basis after excluding M&A impact is 'Transportation Safety', and considering the specific challenges affecting the automotive and consumer electronics markets mentioned, 'Transportation Safety' is the segment that has dragged down 3M's overall growth in 2022 after excluding the impact of M&A activities.",
