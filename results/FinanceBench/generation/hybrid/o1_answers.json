From the tables, consolidated operating income was $20,568M (FY2020), $21,957M (FY2019), and $20,437M (FY2018). Consolidated depreciation and amortization was $10,987M, $10,678M, and $10,529M, respectively. Hence total unadjusted EBITDA for FY2020 = $31,555M, for FY2019 = $32,635M, and for FY2018 = $30,966M. Dividing by consolidated net sales (FY2020: $519,926M; FY2019: $510,329M; FY2018: $495,761M), we get EBITDA margins of approximately 6.1%, 6.4%, and 6.2%. The three-year average rounds to 6.2%.",
