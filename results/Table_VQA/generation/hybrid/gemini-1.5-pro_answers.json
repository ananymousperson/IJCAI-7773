The row \\\"Approved by Shareholders\\\" shows a value of $24.41 for \\\"Weighted average exercise price of outstanding options, warrants and rights\\\".\\n4. However, the table also includes a footnote (6) stating, \\\"RSUs, PSUs, and deferred share rights are not included in determining the weighted average exercise price in column (b).\\\"\\n5. Since the question explicitly asks for outstanding options, warrants, and rights *for* Equity Compensation Plans Approved by Shareholders, and footnote (6) excludes certain components *from* the weighted average exercise price calculation, it can be inferred that the provided value does not accurately represent the desired information.\\n6. Therefore, the answer is N/A as the relevant information is not available within the given context.",

        "reasoning": "1. The question asks for the ending balance for the allowance for doubtful accounts for the year ended December 31, 2013.\\n2. Refer to \"PNR/2014/page_134.pdf\", which provides data for allowance for doubtful accounts.\\n3. The table shows the ending balance for the year ended December 31, 2013 as $58.7 million.\\n4.

        "reasoning": "1. On page 45, it is stated that the interest rate on CMBS Certificates is a weighted average coupon fixed interest rate of 5.9% and the Convertible Senior Notes interest rate of 0.375%.\\n2. Page 97 provides a table of future effect amounts, but does not specify what these amounts represent. It also provides a total amount of $1,292,190.\\n3. Page 90 lists a value of $0.4, but its context is unclear.\\n4. Page 99 discusses changes in benefit obligations and plan assets, which is not relevant to the question of interest payments.\\n5. Returning to page 45 and focusing on the interest rates provided (5.9% and 0.375%), and considering the question\\'s focus on interest payments, we can infer that the relevant context is likely within the section about interest payments and the provided rates.  The available context does not provide the principal amounts to calculate the exact interest payments. However, a table on page 43 lists Long-term debt for 1 year as $1,015,000 and for 2-3 years as $93,459 + $75,039 = $168,498.  Based on the interest rates provided, the lowest possible interest payment would be 0.375% of the principal and the highest would be 5.9% of the principal.  For year 1, the interest would be between $3,806.25 and $59,885.  For years 2-3, the interest would be between $631.86 and $9,941.42.  However, the question asks for the total amount due in 1-3 years.  The minimum amount is $93,459 + $75,039 + $1,015,000 = $1,183,498.  The maximum is the total listed on page 97, $1,292,190.  The interest on $1,183,498 at 0.375% is $4,438.12 and at 5.9% is $69,826.42.  The interest on $1,292,190 at 0.375% is $4,845.71 and at 5.9% is $76,239.21.  Page 43 lists the interest payments for 1 year as $338,182, and for 2-3 years as $46,745.  Since the interest rate is between 0.375% and 5.9%, it\\'s reasonable to conclude the interest payment will be between these values.",
        "answer": "Between $338,182 and $46,745."
