There is no income statement that provides us with the required data in the context given.\n\n3. However, there might be other data that can be used. Looking at the table, there is a column for 2006. The item 'income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change' is not available.\n\n4. The only column that we may relate to the income before taxes is 'Net Sales', which is $2,221.3 million and 'Total operating expenses', which is $1,781.7 million. However, this data needs to be combined with other expenses not on the table to reach a reasonable answer to the question.\n\n5. Looking further down in the table, we can also see 'Interest expenses', 'Income tax expense - continuing', and 'Cumulative effect of accounting change'. Using the Net Sales and subtracting the operating expenses and interest expense before adding the 'Income tax expense - continuing' and 'Cumulative effect of accounting change' could provide the answer needed.\n\n6. However, income tax is paid after taxes, thus does not need to be included. The Net sales minus operating expenses, plus cumulative effect and minus interest expense will be the answer to this problem.\n\n7. Therefore the following calculation can be performed to determine the answer: Net Sales ($2,221.3) minus Operating expenses ($1,781.7) = $439.6. Then add the Cumulative effect of accounting change, 43.5 = $483.1. From here we need to subtract the 63.4 in Interest expense.\n\n8. The answer therefore is: $483.1 - $63.4 = $419.7.",

The context from the PDF-based financial statement includes a 'For the Year Ended December 31' table that lists basic and diluted weighted-average shares outstanding. However, it does not directly specify which year corresponds to which line of data in the table.\nGiven that the question asks for the 2007 data, and considering standard business practice of reporting in chronological order, the most recent year should be listed last. If the format starts with the earliest year first, then the last entry would represent the most recent year - 2007 in this context.\nSince the question asks for Common stock equivalents in terms of their impact on diluted weighted-average shares, this specific number is usually what differs between the basic shares and the diluted shares. The table provides two numbers per year: basic weighted-average shares and diluted weighted-average shares. The difference or change in these numbers can indicate the effect of Common stock equivalents or similar dilutive elements.\nWithout explicit labeling for the year in the table but knowing the most recent data (the lower number based on typical formatting) would reflect 2007, we infer that the last entry under 'Diluted weighted-average shares outstanding' corresponds to 2007.

However, the question asks only for prior year additions based on positions related to the prior year and given the information supplied, the prior year information needed for both the 2016 and 2015 years is the $913 in 2015 additions for 2014 and $2,099 reduction in 2016. In addition, the provided table gives the recognition of the 2016 prior year in the lapses statute of limitations category. By adding together the subtraction from the lapses of the statute of limitations ($3,645) and the addition to 2016 based on prior year of $913 for a net outcome of $2,732. The year over year change without any lapses in the statutes is an increase of $913 in the additions which is the impact of adding in the additions in 2015 based on 2014 prior year and removing lapses based on statute of limitations in 2016 to remove those prior year impacts from the lapses based on statute of limitations. Therefore, it is 0 in 2016 and $913 in 2015 additions based on 2014 and 2013 tax positions related to those respective prior years. That net increase in the additions between the lapses, additions and the reduction in 2016 of the prior years explains why the prior year additions in 2015 based on 2014 position related to that year is $913.

Based on this statement, the S&P 500 Index might have few companies, each with a low market value, or fewer companies, each with a slightly higher market value. As 'the graph and table below assume that $100.00 was invested on September 30, 2011 in our common stock, the S&P 500 Index,' we know that the cumulative return ended on the date of the graph with a normalized starting with $100.

However, the table provides information on the operating income and total premiums earned for each segment. The persistency rate can be estimated as the percentage of policies that remain in force from one year to the next, calculated by dividing the number of policies in force at the end of the year by the number of policies in force at the beginning of the year. It is important to note that when looking at persistency it is not always wise to consider the overall number, especially when significant changes have happened in that year. 3. Since we cannot calculate the exact persistency rate without additional information, we will look for other data that might be of some use. 4. In the 'Benefits and Expenses' section, there is a line titled 'Benefits and Change in Reserves for Future Benefits.' A 'change in benefits' would occur when an existing policy decreases or increases in coverage, value, or if someone makes a claim or withdraws from a product. This is a strong implication that persistency is not very good, presumably since the change in reserves is so high relative to the Benefits.  5. Another data point we have is the income to Net Investment Income ratio. 6. Since it is a good general rule to find persistency in the form of persistency to investment income on a per dollar basis, we can calculate this by dividing other income by investment income. 7. This gives a persistency rate of roughly 2.77 to 1, meaning that some persistency is occurring, but not a lot.",
