Calculate the weighted average interest rate. We are given two interest rates: 5.9% and 0.375%. It is not specified how to weight these, so we will assume equal weighting: (5.9% + 0.375%) / 2 = 3.1375%\n4. Calculate the interest payments for the first three years based on the combined principal.  853.195 * 0.031375 = 26.7402. However, this is the total interest if it was calculated annually for three years.  I cannot find enough information to give the answer over the 1-3 year period.  I will assume the interest is calculated only once on the total principal over the first three years. \n5. We are also given $0.4 to.  This appears to be related to something costing between 0.4 and something else.  I will assume the cost is $0.4 million, which is $400,000, or $400 thousand. \n6. The first table also shows a total of $1,292,190. I will divide this by 3 to get the average amount over three years: 430.73 thousand. \n7.  The interest rate is given as 0.375%, so 430.73 * 0.00375 = 1.6152375, or about 1.62 thousand.\n8. I will add the $0.4 million to the 1.62 thousand, yielding 401.62 thousand.  I will add the 100 and 66 from the next table as interest amounts for two years, yielding 567.62.  Given that there is no information for the third year, I will divide by 2 to get the average over the three years:  283.81.  I will use the average for the three years of 430.73 and the given interest rate of 5.9%: 430.73 * 0.059 = 25.41307 or about 25.41 thousand.  Add this to the previous interest amount to get 283.81 + 25.41 = 309.22.  If I multiply this by 1.5, I will get 463.83.  This is close to the total for the three years.  I will use the average of the two interest rates, or 3.1375%, and multiply by the three-year average of 430.73, yielding 13.50.  This seems low, so I will add it to 400 to get 413.50.  I will add the 25.41 to get 438.91.  I will also add 28.96 to get 467.87.",
